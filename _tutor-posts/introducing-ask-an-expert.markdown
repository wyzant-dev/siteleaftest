## We believe that success in small problems leads to success in big concepts.	

That’s why we’ve created a new place for tutors to expand their business by taking a slightly different approach to helping students in need. 

Ask An Expert is an exciting new Q&A platform driven by the Wyzant tutor community that allows students to submit questions they’d like explained by someone who actually knows what they’re talking about: **a verified subject matter expert.**

### Expand your reach

Ask An Expert is designed to provide tutors with the robust tools and platform necessary to make a lasting impression on countless students - not only the person who posted the question, but anyone who searches for guidance with a similar problem. Tutors can help students by answering questions anytime via text or video answers. Replies include your profile photo and a prominent link to your Wyzant profile, so it’s easy for any student to visit, and reach out to a tutor who finally helped them reach their “a-ha!” moment and book their first lesson for more in-depth help.

**New to tutoring?** Ask An Expert gives you an audience of new students seeking help every day, and while you work toward your first few ratings and reviews, giving some smart advice can get you in front of prospective students before you improve your rank in traditional tutor searches.

### Convert visits into lessons

Using Ask An Expert strategically by answering questions in your key subject areas can help expand your business by providing students with a more-nuanced look at your skills and approach. All of your answers are displayed in a new section of your public profile titled “Examples of Expertise,” and contribute to your profile’s overall relevance to students seeking help with specific subjects. 

Ask An Expert’s tools are easy to use, and give you a choice in how you present your expertise. If you’re a “show, don’t tell” kind of tutor, post **video answers**, powered by Wyzant’s online tool. Demonstrating your approach to key techniques (and giving students a preview of what it’s like to work online with you), is an indispensable tool in any tutor’s kit.

Video answers are displayed more prominently than text on your profile, so it’s easy for students to watch what makes you stand out from the crowd.  

The rich text editor contains everything you need to provide detailed, thoughtful help, including special characters and operations needed for math and science problems and a code editor.

**New to tutoring?** This section of your profile is a great opportunity to showcase your skills in a concrete fashion by giving prospective students the ability to see how you actually tutor. Video answers in particular will let you stand out in a way other tutors won’t.

## Build your brand

Your Ask An Expert content, beyond its role in helping students find and understand your profile, is a robust demonstration of your skills, approach, and personality - relevant information for every student, but hard to illustrate in a real-world context in an online tutoring profile. Each time you engage with a student’s questions, you’re developing your portfolio. Don’t underestimate the importance of wowing a future client!
