On December 6, 2018 we announced the upcoming launch of separate online and in-person hourly rates. For some background on why added this feature and some tips on how to use the separate rates strategically, check out this [blog post](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/tutor/separate-hourly-rates/).

## Setting your default hourly rates 

Tutors who are [certified](https://www.wyzant.com/online/approval) for online tutoring will have the option to set a separate online and in-person hourly rates on their [Rates and Policies](https://www.wyzant.com/tutor/rateandpolicies.aspx) page. 

Technically, every tutor who is certified to tutor online will have an online hourly rate, even if you are opted out of showing up in online searches. The settings on your [Profile Visibility](https://www.wyzant.com/tutor/settings/status) page will still control what searches you show up in and what rates are visible in the *Policies* section of your tutor profile.  

If you are certified to tutor online, but do not want to offer different in-person and online rates, set these two values to be the same amount. Tutors who are not certified to tutor online will still be given the option to schedule or submit online lessons, but in these cases the tutor’s default in-person hourly rate will be used.

Tutors certified to tutor online can also update their online and in-person hourly rates through the iOS and Android Mobile tutor apps.

## Setting custom student rates

As we know some tutors provide both in-person and online tutoring for the same student, you will be able to set two separate custom rates - one in-person and online - for each student from your [Student Connections](https://www.wyzant.com/tutor/students/index) page.

These rates can be updated separately. In order to update a custom student rate use the appropriate rate change request form. If you are not certified to tutor online, you will not see an online rate listed on the student tables.

## Selecting a rate when scheduling or submitting a lesson

When scheduling or submitting a lesson with a student, hourly rates will be listed next to the *Lesson Type* in the *Lesson Details* section. The hourly rate listed beside the lesson type - in-person or online - will reflect the default rates list on your [Rates and Policies](https://www.wyzant.com/tutor/rateandpolicies.aspx) page or (if available) the custom hourly rates for that student listed on your [Student Connections](https://www.wyzant.com/tutor/students/index) page. As noted above, tutors who are not certified to tutor online will still be given the option to schedule or submit online lessons, but in these cases the tutor’s default in-person hourly rate will be listed.    

### Scheduling a lesson if certified for online tutoring:    

Available online and in-person hourly rates will be listed next to the appropriate lesson type.

## What rate will students see?  

In **tutor search and your profile**, students will see the hourly rate that best matches their search - in-person or online. That said, both rates, if available, will be listed on your public tutor profile in the *Policies* section and will be listed here regardless of the student’s search type.

In **messaging**, students will see the hourly rate that best matches their search - in-person or online - and it will show custom students rates if available. 

When submitting **job applications**, the rate shown in the UI will be the rate that best matches the student’s search - in-person or online. As always, you can edit this rate before submitting the job application. If you and the student begin working together, this edited rate will become their recorded custom rate for the lesson type the job was for.
