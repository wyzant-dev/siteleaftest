Staying in contact with your students, even after their sessions in a specific subject have concluded, has proven to increase the number of students that return to tutors on Wyzant for more lessons.

## A new way to stay connected

When it comes to working with students long-term, it's all about communication. We’re privileged to see the impact of 1:1 tutoring every single day because we get to hear students tell us their success stories. 

The common thread between them? Students who feel connected to (and understood by) an educator continue having lessons long after their initial goal has been reached.

According to feedback we’ve received from tutors on the platform, one of the biggest hurdles in retaining students over time is coming up with the right way to “ask for the business” by suggesting another session. That’s understandable - who wants to feel like a salesperson?

We’ve developed a new feature for tutors on Wyzant that takes the hard work out of deciding what to send, and what to say.

## We’re Calling Them Tutor eCards

Reaching out to past [students you’ve helped succeed](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/tutor/first-session/) is a powerful way to remind them of their tutoring experience and bring them back for more learning.

That means long-term growth for your tutoring business.

## How to Send a Tutor eCard

To send an eCard from your tutor dashboard, just navigate to your tutor dashboard and click "Toolkit", then choose "Stay Connected with eCards"

1. Choose the student or students you want to send a card to.
2. Choose a card from the collection.
3. Write a short personal message, or use one of our pre-written examples.
