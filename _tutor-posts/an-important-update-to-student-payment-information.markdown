We’ve heard from many tutors how frustrating and time consuming it can be instructing students to add payment information to their accounts. We listened, and now we’re rolling out an important update to how we talk to students about adding payment information—so you don’t have to anymore.

## What’s changing?
Moving forward, students will be required to add payment information to their account in order to continue messaging with a tutor. After an initial message is sent, a tutor can respond, but the student will not be able to send any additional messages until the payment information is added. This way, you can spend your time responding thoughtfully to each new request you receive without having to worry about whether or not a student has payment on file.  

## Here’s how it will work.
 
If a student foregoes adding payment information during the signup process, they will only be able to send one message to a tutor before being prompted to add it to their account.

We will handle all of the communication to students about how to do so—from app and dashboard notifications to a series of emails—to ensure a better experience from the get-go for both students and tutors alike. 
 
We’ve been testing this new approach with a group of students and it’s proven to be a better experience, helping tutors communicate more efficiently, and helping students get to lessons faster. 

## What does this mean for you?
More time to craft better messages to potential new students. And, the more thoughtful your initial message is, the better your chances are that you will stand out from other tutors and book a new lesson.
