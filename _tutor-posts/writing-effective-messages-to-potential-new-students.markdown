Now that you no longer have to worry about instructing students to add payment information to their accounts, you can get right down to business when one messages you.
 
Remember, the more thoughtful your initial message is, the better your chances are that you will stand out from other tutors and book a new lesson.
 
Keep these three tips in mind when responding to a potential new student:
 
* This the perfect opportunity to reiterate your expertise they were initially drawn to in your profile. Let them know how you’re prepared to help.

* Ask questions and express interest in helping them find the right tutor for their specific needs. Even if this doesn’t end up being you, both of you will be better off in the long run if you ask the right questions up front.

* Set up arrangements for your lesson. You will already have their availability and meeting preferences from their original request, so be sure to propose a time that works for both of you.

As a reminder, here's how your message will appear on site for new students without payment information on file.
