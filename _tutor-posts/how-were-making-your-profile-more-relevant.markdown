We’ve been working hard to enhance our tutor profiles and search results to better highlight your experience and expertise to students. We’ve received input from both students and tutors alike regarding what’s most important when finding the right fit—and these updates will be rolling out soon, so we want to make sure you’re in the loop. Here’s what’s changing...

## Highlighting content that’s specific to a student’s search.
### Subject-specific titles
If you’ve been keeping up with the blog and emails, you’re already familiar with this new feature that launched last week. Subject-specific titles now appear in both search results and on your profile, relevant to what a student has searched for. This is the only change that will require some work on your part—so if you haven’t done so already, head to the [Subjects](https://www.wyzant.com/tutor/subjects/) section of your profile today to write your titles.

### Subject-specific hours
In addition to your total hours tutored on Wyzant, search results and your profile will now also feature the hours you’ve taught for the individual subject for which a student is searching for help. If you haven’t tutored any hours in that particular subject, we’ll simply display your total tutoring hours. Here’s what it will look like:

## Making relevant information easier to find.
In addition to streamlining the tutor search look and feel, we're making a number of updates to your profile to ensure your most relevant information is front and center for prospective students:

### Reviews and ratings
We’ll be moving the ratings histogram (which currently only appears as a pop-up if clicked on) to your “Reviews” section—and renaming this section “Ratings and Reviews.”

### Your “About” section
We’ll also be truncating your “About” section to show only the first 400 characters. The remainder of your paragraph will be viewable by selecting “read more” (as seen below). This will make it easier for students to browse your entire profile for the information they need, increasing the likelihood that they’ll more easily see your ratings and reviews section.

### Highlighting soft skills
Reviews will now be searchable, and will display a subset of pre-defined searchable keywords at the top of the page. These keywords reflect your most commonly mentioned “soft” skills across all of your reviews, and make it easier for students to find a tutor with the specific experience and qualities they’re looking for.

As a reminder, these changes will be rolling out over the next couple of months. And the good news is that the only one that requires a little work on your end is subject-specific titles—so if you haven’t yet, make sure to [add them today](https://www.wyzant.com/tutor/subjects/)! And we’ll handle all the rest to continue improving the Wyzant experience for both tutors and students alike.
