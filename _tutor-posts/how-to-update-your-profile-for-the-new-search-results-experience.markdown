We’re making some important changes to search results based on what we’ve learned creates the most effective student and tutor matches. 
 
Going forward, your profile will only appear in search results for subjects in which you’ve been approved; your “interested” subjects will no longer have an effect on searches conducted by students. Get approved for subjects you want to tutor to ensure potential students can find you.
 
Launching later this summer (giving you a head start), we’ll start displaying new subject-specific titles in search results. For example, if you tutor Spanish and Java, students searching for Spanish tutors will see a title with info about your Spanish expertise, and those searching for Java will see a title relevant to Java. Here’s an example:

You now have the ability to write headlines that are specific to each of your subjects that showcase your relevant expertise. This change will launch later this summer, but you can start writing your headlines today. Here’s how:

In your profile, visit the [Subjects](https://www.wyzant.com/tutor/subjects/) page. Click on a subject, and you’ll see the following pop-up:

<br>

In the first field, compose a title, up to 70 characters, specific to your expertise and qualifications in that subject. You should consider some of the following:

* Years of experience teaching or tutoring that subject
* Degree(s) related to the subject
* Job title, profession, industry
* Certifications, licenses, and awards

Here are some examples:
* PhD in Chemistry with 10+ Years of Teaching Experience
* Senior Software Engineer Specializing in Java
* LEED Certified Architect, AutoCAD Instructor
* Certified Spanish Teacher with 15+ Years of Experience 

And don’t forget - last year we began displaying relevant subject qualifications in search results, as well as the top of your profile, based on search terms. So if you haven’t, be sure to write subject qualifications for each subject as well!

Make sure you’re ready and relevant by visiting your [Subjects](https://www.wyzant.com/tutor/subjects/) page to get approved in the subjects that match your expertise. Once that’s done, make sure to write your new titles.
