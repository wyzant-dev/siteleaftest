Just a quick update!

With both tutors and students using tablets and touch-enabled devices as their primary device more often, it’s increasingly important to provide a premium experience across every device. As such, **Wyzant now allows both tutors and students to use a tablet for their online lessons.**

Almost anything you can do from your desktop, you can do with your tablet as well: video chat, create and share whiteboards with your students, upload and show documents, and more. The only exception to this is that your tablet screen cannot be shared, though students will be able to receive your screenshare on their tablets.

You and your students can use an iPad, Windows Surface, your favorite Android device, or any other touch-enabled device and continue to have the same great learning experience online.  Along with this, **Safari is now a fully-supported browser with Wyzant.**
