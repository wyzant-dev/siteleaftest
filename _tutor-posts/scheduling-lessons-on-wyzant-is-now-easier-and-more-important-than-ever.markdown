### Scheduling lessons helps you.

How? For starters, it builds your ratings and reviews, which inherently leads to more students. Students are 8% more likely to rate a lesson that was scheduled on Wyzant.

### Scheduling Lessons Is Now Easier 
We spent some time exploring how we could make it easier for tutors to schedule lessons on our platform. Here are a few solutions we implemented:
* We redesigned the scheduling interface so you can schedule a lesson straight from your calendar—and fewer steps saves you time.

* We gave students the ability to request a specific lesson time and location directly in messages to help cut down on the back-and-forth that often goes into setting up a lesson. 
* Plus, Android app users can tap on this request to pre-populate a scheduled lesson:

### What’s in it for students?
A lot. 

Scheduling your lessons on the Wyzant platform makes it easier for students to stay on top of their tutoring with everything in one convenient place, including their scheduled lessons, lesson summaries, messages from tutors and more.  

When you schedule a lesson on Wyzant, students automatically receive a confirmation email, as well as a reminder email 24 hours before the lesson start time. If a student has an online lesson, they will receive an additional email right before the lesson is set to start.

We’ve redesigned these emails to give students a better experience with communications about scheduled lessons. Here are the improvements we’ve made—which will launch in the very near future:
* Students can add the lesson directly to their calendar in the click of a button
* Now it’s easier for students to join their online lesson

In addition to the ability to join an online lesson directly from email, when you schedule your lesson on Wyzant, students will also have the option to join the lesson directly from their dashboard.

Moreover, if students have the Wyzant app, they’ll receive push notifications for their lesson reminders as well.
