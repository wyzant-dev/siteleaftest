## In [part one](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/Your_Language_Learning_Mindset) of this two-part article, I wrote about creating the mentality that drives successful language learning. In part two, I offer habits to build your language skills outside of books.

Your progress depends on your outside work.  Try actively employing these longer-term strategies to become more comfortable with all facets of a new language.

### Immerse Yourself Regularly

... or at least get your feet wet. If visiting a Spanish-speaking country or studying abroad aren't realistic options, find opportunities where you are. Do you have friends or coworkers who speaks Spanish? Make it a point to speak with them. For more sustained practice join a local language group. Look up awesome resources like Meetup.com, and take initiative if a group doesn't already exist.

The key is sustained, regular speaking opportunities. Working one on one with a private tutor provides you with a great opportunity to practice while receiving personalized feedback and guidance. 

But don't forget that immersion isn't just verbal. Keep up with news online to gain more technical vocabulary. As you advance, start reading short stories. I've always kept a notebook to write down words, expressions, and constructions I don't know. Then I use them in my own writing.

### Speak Slowly but Correctly

Don't hesitate to speak because you're worried about making mistakes. That said, summon your greatest concentration and make a conscientious effort to choose the right verbs and tenses and make adjectives and nouns match every time. Carelessness leads to bad habits.

#### "You can't improve your performance by just going with the flow."

Don't underestimate the power of visualization and overall mental preparation. When getting ready to speak, take a moment to mentally get in position, much like an athlete would.** You can't improve your performance by just going with the flow.**

### Build a Large Vocabulary

This includes colloquial speech. A lot of times, it's hard to follow a conversation because of unfamiliar cultural references, colloquial expressions and idioms. Once again, write them down.

Speaking improves vastly if you can speak "naturally" and not like a textbook (even if you speak slowly). How is a beginner supposed to know what's "natural" in a given country or language? Use high-quality resources like [wordreference.com](http://www.wordreference.com/) or [tomísimo.org](http://www.tomisimo.org/) (a good example for Spanish). These can tell you how to say “xyz” in a colloquial way. Even better, someone has probably already asked the same question.

### Imitate Sound and Writing

Work on your pronunciation by imitating a native speaker as closely as possible, over and over. Everyone has their preference, and no accent is better than another. Go on YouTube, repeat clips from interviews, movies, whatever, so long as you can **develop an ear for the cadences and sounds.**

Learn the ABC’s and their pronunciation. Don't read Spanish like you read English. The confidence you gradually build about how you sound will boost overall speaking skills.

### Keep Repeating

It's not easy, so don’t be discouraged. Talking on the phone is challenging. So is catching what the radio announcer or soccer commentator is saying. Just keep repeating.

As time goes on, you can find out about different countries' histories, geography, politics, and famous people. You can also "prepare" for future conversations by building up your vocabulary on topics you like talking about.

What has helped you as a student to speak Spanish better and with greater confidence? What has helped you as a teacher or tutor to help others do so?
