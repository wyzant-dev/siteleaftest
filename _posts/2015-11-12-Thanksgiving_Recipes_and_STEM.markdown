## You don’t need Thanksgiving dinner recipes, you need ways to keep your kids engaged while you cook them. Why not use science?

Why science? Because cooking involves a ton of chemistry, for one. This Thanksgiving, help your kids draw that connection while giving them ways to be inquisitive about learning and explore the wonders of food (before and after eating it).

This timeline of experiments will snuggle right up to your Thanksgiving schedule like the words corn- and -ucopia.

### The Parade

Did you know that Paddington Bear’s briefcase is the size of your garage door? Some serious STEM thinking (and work hours) goes into making the balloons that keep our eyes so fixated. Things like:

* The average balloon requires 90 people who weigh at least 120 lbs (how many pounds is that anyway?)

* Most balloons have an average of 12,000 cubic feet of helium in them (enough to fill 2,500 bathtubs)

* Each balloon is a **series of chambers** engineered to hold the desired form (think balloon animals)

Don’t just take our word for it, [Popular Science](http://www.popsci.com/science-and-engineering-macys-thanksgiving-day-balloons) has an eye-opening behind-the-scenes video taken at the warehouse where the balloons are constructed.

**Take it further:** Have some playdough or Clay? As the parade rolls, kids can mold their favorite balloon, whether it’s Pikachu or Spongebob. That’s what the engineers actually do! Follow it up with some brain-stretching by figuring out how a 5-inch high sculpture can become a 43.5-foot long, 55-foot tall gargantuan! Check out the [Parade lineup](http://social.macys.com/parade/) to get some ideas ahead of time.

### The Main Dish

Oh, the mysteries of cooking turkey.

It’s actually ripe with experimentation (and you don’t have to forego Grandma’s recipe). But whether you need help figuring out how long to cook a 20-pound bird, to brining, to getting the perfect heat mix for white vs. dark meat, critical thinking (and/or gooling) opportunities abound.

* How do you cook the legs to 180 degrees and the breast to 160 when they’re attached? (Answered by [Popular Science](http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2007-11/turkey-day-chemistry-kitchen)... again)

* How much water and salt do you need to brine a 15-pound turkey? How about 22 pounds? (Guess first, look [later](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-science-of-cooking-a-turkey-and-other-thanksgiving-dishes-138311115/?no-ist))

* Why does brining work anyway?

**Take it further:** Even if YOU are going to rely on tradition, make like your child’s math skills are the key to the mouth watering. They can take the dimensions of your turkey and figure out cooking time using [this mathematical balance of weight, surface area, and width](http://www.exploratorium.edu/cooking/turkey/index.html).

### The Dessert

If you google “science of cooking pie” you’ll get the feeling that pies are a food chemists’ best friend. If you’ve ever baked a pie before, you might not share that sentiment. From cracking pie crust to over-shrinking fruits to soggy filling, they’re just downright testy.

Ever baked a cranberry apple pie? You're in for a treat. Start them thinking with a pie crust riddle:

*Considering A) These apples are going to shrink when they’re in the oven and B) We don’t want our crust to collapse when they do, how should we cut the apples? And why?*

**Take it further:** You can have some fun pronouncing “anthocyanin” (the pigment that gives cranberries their color), but did you know can take the color out of it with some baking soda and water? In other words, while everyone else is watching football, you can be writing [invisible messages](http://kitchenpantryscientist.com/spy-juice/).

### The Leftovers

Got leftovers? Don’t be too hasty to throw out the remains. From the bones of the turkey to the scraps you cut when making your stuffing, you can get some fun out of them. And your child can get some knowledge.

**Take it further:** Combine a turkey leg bone and enough vinegar to drown it in a jar, and wait three days. You’ll all be surprised at [what happens](https://sciencebob.com/bend-a-bone-with-vinegar/). And did you know you can [save and re-grow green onions](http://fromabcstoacts.com/2013/11/3-family-friendly-thanksgiving-science-experiments.html)?

### Why the Turkey?

We’re pretty sure turkey wasn’t on the table at the first Thanksgiving in 1621. Beyond that, there are only theories as to why this bird became so big on Thanksgiving, including:

* Turkeys were big enough to feed a crowd, but more “dinner-worthy” than chicken

* It was a Christmas meal as well (notably referred to in Dicken’s A Christmas Carol)

* It was the meat of choice when Honest Abe declared Thanksgiving a national holiday in 1863

We know holidays are overwhelming. Hopefully with a pinch of STEM ingenuity, there will be one less reason to pull your hair from it’s roots.
