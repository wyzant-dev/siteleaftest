## School is right around the corner (or has already started for most of you). It’s that time of the year where we get into our “Back-to-School” routines: Shop for new clothes, go to every doctor appointment imaginable, and head to Target to buy what’s left of the school supply section.

In 2015, school supply shopping is more than buying pens and notebooks—it means mobile apps and new ways of doing “old-school” things. With tons of new school supplies available, we’ve narrowed it down to a list of 4 essentials that will make it easier for you to study, stay organized, and keep your grades up.

### 1. [StudyBlue](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/studyblue/id323887414?mt=8)—An app for mobile flashcards and practice quizzes

Studying for tests has been reinvented and is much more efficient thanks to this app. Instead of writing out hundreds of index cards for a test, you can type them on your computer and/or phone instead. So when you’re waiting in line or on-the-go, you can review vocabulary or your study guide for an upcoming test.

And no more giant stack of note cards. It’s a win-win.

### 2. [Self Control](http://selfcontrolapp.com/) (The Mac App)

This app gets its name because it helps with something every 2015 high school and college student struggles with. Nowadays, there are more distractions than ever: Facebook, YouTube, Pinterest, etc. This app lets you block out certain sites on your computer for a specified period of time so you can decrease procrastination and be more productive in class. There’s no shame in having an app for that, right?

### 3. A Planner

It might seem “old-school”, but planners are getting popular again—and way more fun. Why? First, for sensible reasons. Writing out your schedule often makes it easier to keep yourself organized, and remember what’s due and when. Secondly, there are some really cool planners out there (check out [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/market/2015_2016_planner)and [Paper Source](http://www.papersource.com/office/planners/all.html)) with unique designs and patterns.

If you’re not into writing, there are apps on the market to help you plan and set reminders before big assignments and tests. [The Homework App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/homework-app-your-class-assignment/id561371952?mt=8) helps you organize your schedule in a detailed fashion. If you stay on top of a schedule, you’ll find there’s a lot more time to prepare and a lot less cramming (hopefully).

### 4. An Expert Tutor

Tutoring has been around for as long as we can remember. Nowadays, tutors do much more than answer simple homework questions. [Studies have shown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_Sigma_Problem) working one-on-one with a private tutor is the fastest, most effective way to understand complicated concepts, address last-minute homework questions, and improve performance. WyzAnt makes it easy to find affordable and experienced private tutors in-person and online. Have a private tutor by your side so you can have expert whenever you need it. The bottom line is expert help = results you can see.

During this back-to-school season, get prepared with these four “supplies.” Download new apps or try new stylings of old-school ideas with easy and affordable options to start the school year right.
