## Summer is meant for fun and play, but it’s also a time when lots of children forget much of what they learned during the school year. Here’s how to help your child retain those important lessons.

School’s out for the summer!

Many families (and all children!) enjoy this time off from the daily routine of schoolwork, and spend the warmest months relaxing, camping, and playing with friends. But along with popsicles and mosquitos, summertime also brings an interruption of the learning process for elementary school children, and in many cases, significant portions of learning are actually forgotten. When they head back to the classroom at the end of summer, the fun definitely ends. Here’s what it means for your child, along with several tips on how to prevent learning regression.

### What is Summer Brain Drain?

With no school and no homework, most kids go to camp or play all summer long. Sounds pretty great, right?

Unfortunately, it’s not all fun and games. When school is out, most children stop learning. The bad news is that when the learning process stops, not only do children not build on what they already know, but some of that knowledge is forgotten because it’s not used and reinforced. Some people call it brain drain, some call it summer slide, and others call it summer learning loss. But it all means the same thing.

Without anything to challenge them academically over the summer, children lose up to 10% of what they learned during the school year, and math skills are hit the hardest. This means that, during the fall, teachers are forced to repeat lessons from the previous year because they have to bring children back up to speed.

Fortunately, there is a variety of ways you can help your child beat summer brain drain. You can work together or find education help outside your home.

### Helping Your Child at Home

If you want to be part of your child’s summer learning process, there are tons of ways you can help. Elementary school age children can benefit from supplemental learning experiences that are engaging and creative. You have probably already heard or read about many of the possibilities:

* There are dozens of effective online learning activities, printables, and games
* Reading books to and with your child
* Consider a story-writing project: your child can write or dictate a story to you and then make illustrations to go with the story
* Cooking and building projects reinforce math skills
* Art projects using measuring tools like rulers and compasses
* Younger children can find geometric shapes in the world around them
* Assemble 2- and 3-dimensional puzzles
* Count small items like beans or pebbles
* Identify numbers and letters on license plates or count cars while driving
* You can start a neighborhood learning coop

### Getting Help From Others

If you can’t participate in summer learning with your child because you work, or even if you simply aren’t keen on playing the role of tutor yourself, there are plenty of supplemental experiences outside of the home:

* Summer school programs
* Academically oriented camps
* Library reading programs (school and local public libraries)
* Community center children's classes
* Ask teachers for extra work that children can complete when school is out
* Private tutoring

### Preventing Summer Learning Loss

The National Summer Learning Association has [found ](http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.summerlearning.org/resource/resmgr/ssins_/ss_in_s_sample_pages.pdf)there are several approaches that, used in combination, are the most effective in preventing learning loss and keeping your child’s mind engaged. [Research ](http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR815.html)performed by the RAND Corporation supports all of these recommendations.

First, high-quality instruction with reasonably high-performance expectations is important. This means that if you’re helping your child at home, make sure to map out the lessons in advance and let your child know what goals you expect him or her to meet. Providing your child with organized, well-planned instruction will maximize the effectiveness of summer learning.

If you plan to use external resources, guided learning from a professional can smooth the path for any student, whether in small groups or privately. Private tutoring is ideal because the tutor can customize each lesson to your child’s level, challenges, and personality.

But children also benefit significantly from the attention they’ll get in small groups of three to four children. Remember, most school classrooms have an average of 22-26 students, and teachers must spread their attention to all children. Working with just a few other children allows tutors to connect with each child and fosters friendships. All this makes the learning process more enjoyable and therefore more effective.

In terms of the content of what your elementary school child should be working on, there are two important recommendations. First, specifically for math skills, **daily lessons **are crucial for the prevention of learning loss. Second, all subjects should be covered over a period of 4-6 weeks, which means you still have time in your summer for play. These suggestions set up the ideal guide to not only prevent learning reversal but to help students get an edge for the coming year.
