If you’re an aspiring lawyer, chances are you’ve done a fair bit of research to learn all about the LSAT. For those who dream of getting into top-tier schools like Yale, Stanford, or Harvard, an average LSAT score just won’t cut it. You need to score well above 165 to even stand a chance at being considered for admissions.

## What is the LSAT?
The Law School Admission Test (LSAT) is an integral part of the admission process. It assesses critical reading comprehension, analytical and logical reasoning, and writing skills. The LSAT is the only test accepted for admission purposes by all ABA-accredited law schools and Canadian common-law law schools.

The LSAT is administered in two parts:

* A multiple-choice exam administered at official test centers

* A written essay (LSAT Writing Sample), administered online

The test consists of four scored sections, one experimental section, and an unscored essay section. Two of the scored sections are Logical Reasoning, one is Reading Comprehension, and the last is Analytical Reasoning (aka Logic Games). The LSAT is not a test that rewards last-minute cramming, so future test-takers should consider their strategy and prepare thoroughly.

So the best thing to do is to ramp up your prep. For that, you’ll need high-quality resources that can teach you how to study for the LSAT and assure better scores.

This LSAT 101 guide contains links to articles on the Wyzant Blog, giving you everything you'll need to understand the test and maximize your LSAT prep.

It involves knowing which aspects of the test to focus on, maintaining a study schedule, learning testing methods to improve your speed, and more.

It goes without saying that you’ll need to practice a lot (a LOT), so your online LSAT prep should also include knowing where to get LSAT practice tests, and how best to take them.

## Understand each section on the LSAT

The LSAT, unlike tests many students are accustomed to taking during college, rewards one’s ability to apply logical concepts to new yet predictable arguments, scenarios, or sets of related statements rather than regurgitate facts accrued over the course of a semester.

### LSAT logical reasoning

Among all the LSAT test sections, logical reasoning takes center stage, and accounts for half of your total score. The LR section features short arguments, sets of facts, or a paradoxical situation. You’ll be asked to do a variety of things, such as strengthen or weaken the argument, determine a logical conclusion, explain a paradox, or make inferences.

With questions designed to confuse you, tackling the logical reasoning section of the LSAT can take up a lot of your time. As such, it’s crucial that you focus your efforts on understanding the basic strategies to answer logical reasoning questions without spending too much time on them. 

This article will help you learn the do’s and don’ts of tackling the LR section of the test, which might help you avoid costly mistakes and improve your overall LSAT scores.

### LSAT Logic Games (Analytical Reasoning)


For many, logic games are initially the most difficult (but ultimately the most improvable) of the 3 kinds of LSAT multiple-choice sections: it’s foreign to a majority of those preparing for the LSAT, so most students start far back on what can be a steep learning curve. Thankfully, logic games are based purely on deduction, so some definitions can be considered mathematics, and accordingly can be mastered more easily with intensive practice than can something lik, say, the Reading Comprehension section of the LSAT.

### Reading Comprehension
Believe it or not, there are strategies to improve how quickly you comprehend a given passage and derive correct answers from it! The LSAT reading comprehension involves reading a passage and using your understanding of the information (as well as the ways the writers of the LSAT throw in things to misdirect test-takers) to answer the given questions.

To work faster on reading comp questions, you’ll need to learn how to standardize your reading process and better understand a given text. You might even need to take a different approach based on the type of question you’re getting. Reading comprehension tends to be the least improvable section of the test given how well ingrained a student’s reading ability is by the time they sit to take the LSAT, but test-takers still need to give the section its due.

### LSAT Writing Sample
The good news: LSAT test-takers no longer must complete a writing sample shortly after 5 LSAT multiple choice sections. Now, they get to complete LSAT Writing up to a full year after their test date.

The bad news: a higher standard of writing will likely be expected given that test-takers may now optimize or at least try to optimize outside factors

Although the essay section won’t have an effect on your overall LSAT scores, that doesn’t make it any less important. Since your writing sample can be considered by universities, it's crucial that you spend an equal amount of time and effort into improving your LSAT writing. Tackling prep for the LSAT should involve thorough writing practice in addition to practicing other sections of the test that get scored. Read the article below for more details.
