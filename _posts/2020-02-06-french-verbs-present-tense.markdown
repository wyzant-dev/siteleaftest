If your goal is to be fluent in French, you're going to have to make peace with verb conjugations. Conjugations are rules about how you say a verb depending on the tense, mood, and subject of a sentence. If you’re an adult native English speaker, you probably spend very little time, if any at all, thinking about English verb conjugations.

When you’re [learning a new language](https://www.wyzant.com/French_tutors.aspx), though, you have to. French conjugations are not  usually intuitive to English speakers. Though many French tenses have direct English equivalents, many don't. If, like many first-time French language learners, you're trying to pick up the basics for [an upcoming trip](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/basic-french-words-phrases/), conjugations can seem intimidating.

The most logical place to start is *le present*, or the French present tense. It's the most commonly used French verb tense and a subset of *le mode indicatif* or indicative mood (the other moods are *imperatif*, *conditionnel*, and *subjonctif*). It is meant to be used to describe facts, current actions, and repeated actions.

## Infinitives and stems

Before you start conjugations, including [past](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/french-past-tense/), present, and future tenses, you need to know about infinitives. For non-grammar-nerds among us, the infinitive is the **base of the verb**. In English they are written as “to _____,” or “_____ing,” but in French they're one word. So, “to speak” and “speaking” in English both translate to *parler* in French.

The first step of conjugating French verbs is to chop off the ending to make it a stem (this applies to all French tenses except [*futur simple*](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/french-future-tense/) and *conditionnel*, which both attach the ending directly to the infinitive).

The next step is to attach a new ending to the stem depending on the subject that precedes it:

* Je = I

* Tu = you, singular and informal

* Il = he

* Elle = she

* Nous = we

* Vous = you, plural and formal

* Ils = they, masculine

* Elles = they, feminine

A fundamental rule in [French grammar](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/french-grammar-basics/) is that there are three categories of regular verb infinitives: ones that end in “-er”; ones that end in “-re”; and ones that end in “-ir”. “-Er” verbs are the most common regular verbs, followed by “-ir”, then “-re”.

## Regular -er Verbs

### Parler (to speak)

* Je parle

* Tu parles

* Il/Elle/On parle

* Nous parlons

* Vous parlez

* Ils/Elles parlent

## Notable irregular “-er” verbs

If the infinitive ends in “-yer”, change the “y” to an “i” in all conjugations **except** for *nous* and *vous*.

Here's an example of a verb that follows this pattern:

### Envoyer (to send)

* J’envoie

* Tu envoies

* Il/Elle/On envoie

* Nous envoyons

* Vous envoyez

* Ils/Elles envoient

The verb *payer* (to pay) also follows this pattern.

If the infinitive ends in “-ger”, keep the "-e" in the ending for *nous* to maintain the soft "g" sound:

### Manger (to eat)

* Je mange

* Tu manges

* Il/Elle/On mange

* Nous mangeons

* Vous mangez

* Ils/Elles mangent

If the infinitive ends in “-cer”, add *une çedille* (that’s ç) to the ending of *nous* to maintain the soft "c" sound. Here's an example:

### Lancer (to throw)

* Je lance

* Tu lances

* Il/Elle/On lance

* Nous lançons

* Vous lancez

* Ils/Elles lancent

If the infinitive ends in “-eler” or “-eter”, double the consonant before the "e" for all conjugations **except** *nous* and *vous*, like in *appeler*:

### Appeler (to call)

* J’appelle

* Tu appelles

* Il/Elle/On appelle

* Nous appelons

* Vous appelez

* Ils/Elles appellent

There are some exceptions, like *acheter* (to buy), *déceler* (to discover), *geler* (to freeze), *haleter* (to pant), *harceler* (to harass), *modeler* (to model), and *peler* (to peel).

If the infinitive includes an “é”, it becomes an “è” in all conjugations **except** *nous* and *vous*:

### Céder (to concede)

* Je cède = I concede

* Tu cèdes

* Il/Elle/On cède

* Nous cédons

* Vous cédez

* Ils/Elles cèdent

If the infinitive includes an unvoiced “e”, add an *accent grave* (that’s è) for all conjugations except *nous* and *vous*:

### Acheter (to buy)

* J’achète

* Tu achètes

* Il/Elle/On achète

* Nous achetons

* Vous achetez

* Ils/Elles achètent

## Regular -ir Verbs

* Je fini

* Tu finis

* Il/Elle/On finit

### Partir (to leave)

* Je pars

* Tu pars

* Il/Elle/On part

* Nous partons

* Vous partez

Other verbs that use this pattern include *dormir* (to sleep), *se sentir* (to feel), *sortir* (to go out), and *servir* (to serve).

* Tu sais

* Il/Elle/On sait

* Nous savons

* Vous savez

* Ils/elles savent

All verbs that end in “-oir” are irregular, but no others follow the exact conjugation of *savoir*.

## A few present tense tips to remember

You're getting closer to mastering French verb conjugations. Bonus: you learned some new vocabulary! Obviously, memorizing all infinitives requires a lot of brain space, so here a few summary points to keep in mind while you continue your French learning.

* If you guess that the ending for *nous* contains “-ons” somewhere, the ending for *vous* contains “-ez” somewhere, and the ending for *ils or elles* contains “-ent” somewhere...you’re usually right!

* When *ils/elles* **does not** end in “-ent”, it typically ends in “-ont”.

* For many irregular “-ir” and “-re” verbs, the conjugations for je and tu are the same. For regular and many irregular “-er” verbs the conjugations for *je* and *il/elle/on* are the same. See if you notice any other patterns on your own.

* Conjugations require a lot of rote memorization. You'll get better by using them.
