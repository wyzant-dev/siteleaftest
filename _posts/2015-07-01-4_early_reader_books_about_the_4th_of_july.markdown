## Parades! Picnics! Fireworks!

With the 4th of July right around the corner, it’s a great opportunity to pop into your local library or bookstore (or hop on your Kindle) and pick up an early reader book about the upcoming holiday. Whether your child is an avid or hesitant reader, providing them with stories that they can easily relate back to their experiences is a great way to capture their interest and engage their minds.

Here are four of our favorites:

[The Night Before the Fourth of July](https://www.amazon.com/The-Night-Before-Fourth-July/dp/0448487128/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_z). With big illustrations and simple language, this book tells the story of a family getting ready for, and celebrating the fourth of July. Age range: 3 - 5 years.

[Apple Pie 4th of July](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/015202543X/ref=nosim/wwwapples4thetec). An award-winning story about a young girl's experience as a first-generation Chinese-American during the 4th of July. Library School Journal says, “This simply told story explores a child's fears about cultural differences and fitting in with understanding and affection.” Age range: 3 - 5 years.

[Looking for Uncle Louie on the Fourth of July](https://www.amazon.com/Looking-Uncle-Louie-Fourth-July/dp/1590780612). Set in South Texas, this brightly illustrated book depicts an exciting 4th of July parade with marines, dancers, and lowriders! LSJ says, “A solid addition to holiday collections, this book would also work well in summer storytimes.” Age range: 4 - 8 years.

[L is for Liberty](https://www.amazon.com/L-Is-Liberty-Reading-Railroad/dp/0448432285/ref=pd_rhf_dp_s_cp_3?ie=UTF8&refRID=0QV7THDQ1F16FTVBNRM3). With bold illustrations and straight-forward language, this book celebrates the Statue of Liberty, including the history of the statue and what it represents -- freedom. Age range: 4 - 8 years.

**Quick tips for encouraging your early reader:**

* Read with your child. When they see you doing something, they’ll be more inclined to engage!

* Help your child find books that are at their reading level. If you’re unsure if the book they’ve chosen is a good match for their reading level, use the “Rule of Thumb”: ask them to read a page of the book, holding up one finger for every word they don’t know. If they reach their thumb before the page is over (i.e. 5 words they don’t know), then the book is probably too hard for them to read on their own. Encourage them to try another book at a lower reading level, but about a similar subject.

* Engage them in conversation after the story. Tell them what you liked about it and what (or who) it reminded you of. Ask them questions, too - what did they like about the story?

* Relate the story to upcoming or past events in your child’s life.

* If your child is struggling with reading, consider connecting them with an expert tutor who specializes in elementary reading, and can help him or her get up to speed before the upcoming school year begins.
