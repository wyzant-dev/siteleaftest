Over the last 10 years, we’ve come a long way. We’ve evolved from a tutoring directory into a community where learners of all ages and skill levels come to connect with expert instructors across the country. And it’s time we had a look that reflects that evolution.

So get ready, world! Starting today, Wyzant has a brand new look.

What’s that mean? Well, if you visit our site or go into our apps, you’ll notice that we overhauled everything visual. We’ve updated our logo, app icons and even our website.

The inspiration behind it was simple. We wanted our brand to reflect the company that you’ve helped us become—the country’s leading way to find and work with an amazing instructor in more than 300 subjects.  

Today, not only are instructors on Wyzant assisting students as they tackle the rigors of a K-12 education, but they’re also meeting the needs of today’s adult learners. That’s an incredible responsibility and not one we take for granted.

Our new logo pulls from the company’s heritage and illustrates the thing about Wyzant we love most: the effectiveness of 1-to-1 instruction in helping people reach their goals faster. It’s no coincidence that the two letters fit together the way that they do.

And while the look and feel of Wyzant has changed, you can rest assured that we are the same service you have grown to love and trust. We are still the best place to:

* Find an expert instructor in more than 300 subjects
* Access more than one million instructor ratings and reviews
* Book an in-person lesson
* Utilize the industry’s best online tutoring product

Today’s launch is simply another chapter in Wyzant’s journey to better meet the evolving needs of our students. We’ve relied on you -- our trusted network of students and instructors -- to provide feedback throughout this process. And we’re excited to continue this work as we look to continue building the most innovative and comprehensive education platform.
