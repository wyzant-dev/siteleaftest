## In the days leading up to the most important tests of the year, you may find yourself searching in backpacks and under beds for ways to give your kids that extra edge over their upcoming standardized testing. For those of us whose state has its first Common Core based test in 2015, any anxiety is likely double.

What definitely isn’t helping most parents is the fact that younger students are often missing core principles related to standardized testing. While this final stretch is not the time to re-review everything learned over the school year, it’s great for honing in on some carefully planned exercises that can make your child a better test-taker.

Make the most out of this last month by addressing the **six key fundamentals of test-taking**, and make sure a case of test-jitters doesn’t rob your child of answers they would normally know.

## 1. Work Through Stress

As something that only happens once per year, the long-format testing atmosphere is completely foreign to most younger students. Seemingly small challenges—like sitting still—can trigger a (preventable) meltdown for K-8 test-takers. When that happens, say bye-bye to a can-do attitude.

The key is to expose them to the testing-taking scenario in advance. Start by researching the type of test taken in your state. It’ll likely be the [Smarter Balanced Assessment](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.smarterbalanced.org%2Fsample-items-and-performance-tasks%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHxpV6UXAMEKmlb1DnBXwbHKu1pUA) or the PARCC. Once you know for sure, make time to practice the test once a week up until the real thing. You can work with your child or bring in a [private tutor](https://www.wyzant.com/tutorsearch) who specializes in testing to help you.

#### "Seemingly small challenges—like sitting still—can trigger a (preventable) meltdown for K-8 test-takers."

In the weeks leading up to testing, your child should be at the point where they can make it 80% (ideally more) through the length of a standardized test in one sitting. Pay attention to behavioral cues as they take the test (fidgeting, etc.) as well as if there is any drop-off during the middle and end of the tests.

## 2. Improve Reading Stamina

Another issue often unforeseen by adults is the inability to read for a long enough time. Have you ever gotten glossy-eyed reading that tenth overly-long email of the day? Or struggled to retain information from an exasperating company wide report? The same thing happens for kids.

First, learn what you’re up against. By pairing this [PARCC testing time table](http://www.parcconline.org/news-and-updates/298-spring-2015-test-administration-update) with [practice tests](http://parcc.pearson.com/practice-tests/) (accessible according to grade range), you’ll get an idea of the amount of time they’ll have eyes glued to the paper or screen during standardized testing.

As with the testing scenarios, start with a lower threshold and build. If possible, read daily, mixing in different types of material they enjoy. You can also vary how your student reads (read alongside them or have them read alone, silently, or out loud).

## 3. Practice Following Directions

Misunderstanding directions is an easy way for things to quickly go downhill. Combat this by incorporating the following of directions into things your student enjoys. Or better yet, things you don’t often let them do.

Have a child who’s interested in helping you cook? Give them a recipe they enjoy and stand alongside them, making sure they follow the recipe. Or you could unplug that game console (or the internet) and give them directions to get it working again.

**Remember**: It’s important to instill the habit of **double-checking** what they read. Likewise, reinforce and gauge progress, personally identifying troublesome test directions before weekly practice tests.

## 4. Learn the 12 “Testing Words”

Ask your 9 year old what “analyze,” “evaluate,” or “summarize” means. There’s a good chance they won’t know one or two of those words. And if they do, they probably won’t know the difference between “contrast” and “compare.”

#### "What if you could capitalize on your child's wants for their own test-taking advantage?"

The point being that standardized tests use a number of words outside the vocabulary of the average student. Twelve to be exact. Don’t worry, though, educational consultant Larry Bell has already covered this ground. His presentation [12 powerful words](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fentress.k12tn.net%2FLarryBellStrategies%2F12powerfulwords.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEltatYeZlw4vtnv12D6KMX7nbMeQ) is an easy step-by-step to introducing these concepts.

## 5. Organize Thoughts

A hard thing for young students to grasp and older ones to execute is organizing their thoughts before a writing assignment. The reality is kids of all ages are constantly backing up opinions with reasons (Hint: the basis of writing an essay). Most of the time, it’s to convince parents to let them do things—sometimes things you don’t want them to.

What if you could capitalize on your child's wants for their own test-taking advantage?

For K-3rd graders, test them on something they’ve watched or read recently. Have them write down the beginning, middle, and end of a movie or TV show. For older students, task them with writing a letter supporting “Why I should be able to eat ice cream everyday” or “Why I should be able to play Minecraft for another 40 minutes.”

## 6. Manage the Time

Not to be forgotten is drilling them with the old mantra “If you don’t know it, go back to it.” While it’s a cliche of test-taking which the teacher has undoubtedly covered, it’s worth doing everything possible to make sure that test gets **finished**.

Besides the obvious incorporation of time management into practice tests, work on it during everyday scenarios by turning chores into an opportunity to gain play or game time. Propose a challenge where every minute less than X amount of time it takes to clean their room, they get those minutes added on to the activity of their choice. For extra practice, talk them through a game plan of how they can work faster.

By focusing on these high-value activities, you can make a whole world of difference for your child on test day. It could even let the worrying end for both of you.

If you need extra support to put these ideas into action, a private tutor could be an effective and time-saving option.
