It seems that every day the ripple effects of COVID-19 keep expanding. As the nation’s largest tutoring marketplace, Wyzant and its 60,000 tutors have observed major changes to students, their needs, and the role of tutoring. In many ways, tutors are on the frontlines of the education crisis, working to keep students learning as their routines and support systems have been turned upside down. We asked tutors what they’re experiencing, and here’s what we learned. 

## 1. Tutors are playing the role of teacher and professor

In normal times, teachers introduce concepts and provide detailed instructions for each assignment. Tutors, typically, help fill in the gaps. Now, tutors are doing more of both. As one tutor put it, “I have more requests along the lines of what am I supposed to do for this assignment, because a lot of professors don’t explain things in detail in the written instructions and would ordinarily clarify during lecture or office hours. I’ve seen a ton of assignments so I’m good at guessing what the professor really wants.” [Lisa](https://www.wyzant.com/match/tutor/80390040) from Oklahoma adds, “We tutors need to be prepared to offer original lessons and materials to help supplement distance learning (plans) received from their teachers.”

## 2. Students need more engagement, enrichment and empathy

Parents are beginning to worry COVID brain drain, and are looking for ways to keep their kids learning. Many students, including adult learners, are also seeking to use their time productively and stay sharp. Everyone is anxious. As [Sandie](https://www.wyzant.com/match/tutor/86304442) says, “The main thing our students need are words of encouragement, lessons that reflect the individual students' differences, and some humor added to the lessons. The parents and the students want to feel connected.” And according to [Jonathan](https://www.wyzant.com/match/tutor/79952660) from Pennsylvania, students are experiencing “boredom, frustration, and confusion. I try to provide some stability, listen to their concerns and provide what reassurance I can.”

## 3. Students need help with organization and study skills

Without the structure and routine provided by schools and universities, students are all of a sudden expected to take a self-directed approach to learning. This requires significant discipline and is particularly tough for younger students. Students have to manage more on their own. They receive large packets of work and have to budget their time. Proper [study skills](https://www.wyzant.com/study_skills_tutors.aspx) have become more important than ever as students and parents struggle with how to [effectively tackle remote learning.](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/remote-learning-homeschool-faqs/)

## 4. Parents aren’t teachers, and most don’t want to be

With a tutor or “academic coach” in the mix, many parents feel that the dynamics of the household change for the better simply because they can interact differently with their child. As a parent, there is a big difference in the overall mood of your home when you can start asking “How was your homework?” instead of “Did you do your homework?” 

## 5. Online (daytime) lessons are the default

Even prior to COVID, [online tutoring](https://www.wyzant.com/online/student) had become the norm. However, many students and parents were still hesitant. Now over 95% of lessons are happening online, with all the real-time interaction that you’d experience in-person. 

The pandemic has altered how millions around the globe learn and are educated. The slow pace of change in traditional academic institutions is making it clear that innovative new solutions are needed to determine how education functions in a post-COVID-19 world. In just a matter of a few weeks, we’ve seen new approaches taking shape - including governments, publishers, content creators, educators, tech providers, and especially tutors - rethinking how we use [remote learning](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/types-of-remote-learning/) and [online platforms](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/online-learning-tool-video/) as a temporary solution to the crisis. Will this lead to more prevalent and consequential trends to the future of education?
