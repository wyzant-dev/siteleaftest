# While the reasons to think online tutoring isn’t the right option might be popping into your head (“It’s complicated,” “The experience would be a pain,” or “I already have a tutor”), the flexibility alone is reason enough to try.

Working with a tutor online doesn’t just open the doors to teachers across the country. It opens the door to working with your existing tutor more frequently, at the last second, or as happens during summer, when you’re out of town.

From the budget-conscious to the time-strapped, working virtually is a compelling and effective solution for students needing an expert tutor. And it’s just one more thing making private tutoring something everyone can enjoy and benefit from.

Of course, some subjects are friendlier than others to online, but how do you know if online tutoring is the solution for you? If you catch yourself saying or feeling any of the following, you might want to try online tutoring:

# “Tutoring needs to be fast—or often.”

When it comes to last-minute study sessions, online is a grade-saver. Of course we make it possible to find and communicate with a tutor in less than 24 hours. Some of the best tutors on WyzAnt respond in less than two!

You’ll free yourself from the mercy of scheduling. With the expanded search of online tutors and relief of not having to travel, online tutoring enables and incentivizes a tutor to expedite scheduling a lesson. So your student can get help when you need it, if not quicker.

By mixing online with in-person, it can be easier to get one last sessions in before an exam and if a regularly scheduled in-person lesson falls through, you can still meet up online.

# “We need content knowledge (and not study skills).”

Online tutoring is at its best when the tutoring need is based on getting help on specific concepts within a subject. To put it simply, the results are much better when students have the foundational skills needed to be an effective student.

Organization, handwriting, and note-taking are things that can all be taught, but observation is the key to diagnosing them. A messy backpack or illegible handwriting won’t be immediately evident through a screen-to-screen interaction. Explaining the laws of physics, on the other hand, is a piece of cake.

# “I need more choices.”

If you live in a smaller metropolitan area or are seeking help in a less popular subject, finding the perfect tutor for you might require broadening the search. Being open to online tutoring widens your web of potential tutors.

# “We need extra help.”

Going virtual allows students and parents who are already taking lessons to augment their schedules without adding a significant time crunch. It makes it easy for those who've worked with a private tutor to get down to business with a new teacher and in a new subject. As an added advantage, it enables older children to set their own schedule.

It won't work as well for kids who have trouble communicating their struggles, or with students who haven’t experienced working one-on-one with a tutor.

# “We want a neutral spot that’s easy to get to.”

Whether it's about commuting or just not wanting to have someone in your home, online tutoring offers a designated space where it’s easy to meet up.

That space is both secure and flexible, while eliminating behind-the-scenes costs. So everyone involved saves the time and money that would normally be sucked into finding a location and the ensuing commute.

The reasons for considering online tutoring are numerous. It’s a creative way to take control of your schedule while meeting the needs of you, your tutor, and most importantly, your student.
