Nowadays, Spanish is the second largest language in the United States. Many students are looking for different ways to learn it. It has become practical. As a first-time student, you might be wondering how to learn Spanish faster. One way to achieve it is by learning basic phrases and words. Perhaps you are interested in teaching phrases on how to introduce yourself, to ask questions, to order food, or to travel. This guide will present you with useful Spanish phrases for beginners.

First, it is essential to understand how to speak and write in Spanish. For that, we will first look at general information on pronunciation, accents, accents marks, and some grammar rules.

## Pronunciation

Generally, in a word in Spanish, each vowel and each consonant are almost often pronounced.

The pronunciation may indeed vary according to some Spanish dialects. In Spain, for example, the consonant c is pronounced like” th” of thanks. That pronunciation occurs when the consonant c is accompanied by the vowels “e” and “i.”  However, the same consonant is pronounced as “s” in Latin America. Also, the z is pronounced like “th” of thief in Spain. But the same consonant is pronounced like “s” in Latin American.

The consonant ll is pronounced like the y as in yellow in most countries of Latin America, but in Argentina and Uruguay is pronounced like the sound “sh” of the word shoe in English.
Other sounds are pronounced differently than in English. The consonant h is silent, so it is never uttered. The j is pronounced similar to the h in hello. The ñ is stronger than an n and sounds closer to a “ny” sound.

The r is a soft vibration, and the rr is a rough vibration using the tongue.

Last but not least, the q like in queso, for example, is pronounced like the c of “cat.” The u following q is always silent. So, the word que, which means what in English is pronounced keh. (insert link on Spanish pronunciation)
One best way to learn Spanish is by practicing these sounds. You will feel more comfortable using them regularly, and your pronunciation will be refined.

## Accents
Accents are important to stress words correctly. For example, the word intelligent in English is stressed in the syllable “te.” In contrast, the word in Spanish inteligente is emphasized in the syllable “gen.” 

Another example is the word ac-ti-vi-ty. In English, it is stressed on the syllable “ti.” In contrast, actividad (activity) in Spanish is emphasized in the last syllable ac-ti vi-dad.

A good number of words in Spanish have stronger stress in one syllable. 

There are other words, though, that don’t have stress in any syllable. Most of them are monosyllables like articles el, la, los, las (the) and possessives mi, su, tu, sus. (my, your, his, hers).

## Spanish accent marks
In Spanish, accent marks are essential. More often, an accent (or lack of it) completely changes the meaning of a word. For example, llamo (present tense for I call) and llamó (preterite tense for he or she called)

Spanish uses three types of accent marks: the dieresis (ü), the virgulilla (ñ), and the acute accent (é).
The dieresis (ü) is used on top of the vowel u in certain words after the letter g to request that the u must be pronounced. For example, cigüeña (stork).

The virgulilla (ñ) is only used on top of the letter n. When we see a word with a virgulilla it suggests to pronounce the n stronger. The sound is like a “ny” sound. For example, año (year), niño, (boy), and baño (bathroom).

The acute accent is the most common accent mark in the Spanish language. It can appear above all five vowels: á, é, í, ó, ú. At most, it appears once per word. Generally, an acute accent is used to denote word stress. For example, the word canción (song) has a sharp emphasis on the vowel ó. This suggests stressing more on the last syllable of can-ción. Most of the words in Spanish have an accent. But not all the words have acute accents. Only the words that follow specific rules. We will leave those rules for another article. The main goal is to understand that when we see a word with an acute accent, the stress will be stronger in that syllable. (insert link on Spanish accents marks)

## Some Spanish grammar rules
Verb conjugation: verbs conjugate differently according to personal pronouns and tenses. For example, the verb to have is tener. In the present tense, it conjugates as yo tengo (I have), but it conjugates as tú tienes for you have.

Genre and number: Nouns in Spanish have gender. They are either feminine or masculine. Consequently, they must be used with articles and adjectives that match their gender. When nouns become plural, the articles and adjectives also adapt to the sentence accordingly. For example, La mesa roja, which is the red table. Mesa is feminine, so the article la is used, and the color rojo is adjusted to feminine replacing an a for an o at the end roja. Here another example, the phrase los restaurantes nuevos, which means the new restaurants. Restaurantes is a masculine word and, in this case, is plural. The article los is adjusting to the noun to match masculine and plural. Also, the letter s is added at the end of the adjective nuevos to match the noun (restaurantes) to masculine plural.

## Useful Spanish words and phrases
Now that there is a better comprehension of how to speak and write in the language, we will look at useful Spanish words and phrases. This second part will cover greetings, introducing yourself, being polite, asking for help, formulating questions, making polite requests, apologizing, and ordering food.

### Greetings
The most popular Spanish greetings are hola and adiós. They are used to say hello and goodbye. Hola is generally used between friends, family, and people we already know. In a more formal setting, like in the airport or to talk to people you don’t know, other greetings are more appropriate. For instance, buenos días (good morning), buenas tardes (good afternoon), or buenas noches (good evening) is more appropriate. Adiós or chao are used to say goodbye. Here there is a list of more Easy Spanish Phrases related to greetings.

* Hola- “Hello”
* Buenos Días – Good morning
* Buenas Tardes – Good afternoon
* Buenas Noches – Good evening
* Adiós – Goodbye, bye
* Chao – Goodbye, bye
* Hasta mañana – See you tomorrow
* Nos vemos – See you

### Introducing yourself and starting Conversation
¿Cómo te llamas? or ¿Cuál es tu nombre? are questions used to ask what is your name? To reply, you can say me llamo (literally I am called) or mi nombre es… (my name is…).

If you are in a formal setting or asking someone you just met for the first time, the questions change slightly to ¿Como se llama? or¿Cuál es su nombre? 

¿Cómo estás? is used to ask, how are you? in an informal setting. ¿Cómo está? without the s is used in formal settings and with people you don’t know.

There is also ¿Qué onda? or ¿Qué cuentas? They mean what’s up and what’s new. Both used in casual and informal situations only with close friends and family. 

¿Qué tal? is a very general greeting. You can use it with everyone regardless of their age and how well you know them. It works just like ¿Cómo estás?

This could be helpful when travelling, meeting new people or even in your first Spanish tutoring class. 

Here are some more ways to greet someone and introduce yourself in Spanish:

* ¿Cómo te llamas? – What is your name? (informal)

* Gracias- Thank you
* Muchas gracias- Thank you very much
* Muchísimas gracias-Thank you very much
* Por favor - please
* De nada- Your welcome
* Es un placer- It is a pleasure
* Con mucho gusto- It is a pleasure

### Asking around for help
If you ever encounter a problem when you are on a trip, getting information, or shopping, the following phrases should be helpful. Since you are going to talk to strangers, then keeping the grammar in formal mode is advisable. Puede ayudarme por favor? is Could you please help me? Or you can ask if the person speaks English, ¿Habla inglés?

* ¿Puede ayudarme, por favor? - Can you help me, please?
* ¿Habla inglés? – Do you speak English?
* ¿Cuánto es? or Cuánto cuesta? -How much is it?
* ¿Dónde está? – Where is?
* ¿Qué hora es, por favor?  ¿Qué hora tiene por favor? – What time is it, please?
* ¿Hay un banco cerca? Is there a bank nearby?
* ¿Cómo llego al aeropuerto?  How do I get to the airport?
* ¿Cómo llego al museo? How do I get to the museum?

### Asking questions
When learning the language, knowing the first words to start formulating questions will help you organize your sentences. ¿Qué? Is the most popular term for what? You might use it to ask about anything in general. ¿Cuál? is also used for que but mainly means which. It suggests picking one of a group. ¿Por qué? spelled separated is why and porque spelled together is because.

* ¿Qué? – What?
* ¿Cuál? – What? which?
* ¿Cómo? – How?
* ¿Por qué? – Why?
* Porque - because
* ¿Qué es esto? - What is this?

### Making polite commands and small requests
Whether you are traveling, ordering food, meeting new people, or in a first Spanish lesson, these phrases will help you make small requests.

* Tengo una pregunta - I have a question
* ¿Cómo se dice…? – How do you say…?
* ¿Qué es…? – What is…?
* Repita por favor – Repeat, please
* No entiendo – I don’t understand
* No sé – I don’t know
* ¿Puedo ir al baño, por favor? – Can I go to the restroom, please?
* Explique otra vez, por favor – Explain again, please.
* Hable más despacio por favor- Speak slower, please.
* Llame un taxi, por favor- Call a cab, please.
* Necesito ayuda, por favor – I need help, please

### Apologizing

Disculpe means excuse me when you want to ask a question to a stranger. ¿Disculpe, dónde está el banco? Excuse me, where is the bank? It also means excuse me if you are giving forewarning that you are weaving through. Disculpe, voy a pasar. Excuse me, I am passing through.

Perdón is used to say I am sorry if you bump into someone. Lo siento does mean I am sorry, but usually used to say I am sorry for feeling someone’s tragedy (I am sorry for you).

* Disculpe - excuse me
* Perdón, perdóneme – excuse me, I am sorry (if you bump into someone)
* Disculpe, disculpeme – excuse me (giving forewarning)
* Lo siento or lo lamento - I am sorry or I am sorry for you (for feeling someone’s tragedy)

## Ordering food in Spanish
Quiero literally means I want, but unlike English, quiero is polite in Spanish. Me gustaría is the literal translation of I would like. However, we don’t really use it when ordering food. 
For example, if you are ordering something to drink for yourself, “Quiero un vaso de agua, por favor. I want (would like) a glass of water, please. Adding the word por favor (please) at the end will complement politeness.

If you are with a group of people and you would like to order for each of you, then para mí, (for me) can be used to order for yourself, para él (to order for a male, para ella (to order for a female). For example, Para mí, un jugo de naranja, para él una cerveza y para ella un café con leche. Literally translated to for me, orange juice, for him a beer, and for her a latte.

When asking for a glass of wine, we say Quiero una copa de vino. Vaso is generally the word for glass. But copa is used only when drinking wine. Red wine is vino tinto and not vino rojo. White wine is vino blanco.

When asking for the check is la cuenta, por favor. Instead of saying I would like the check please, we just go straight to "the check, please." 

Here are more useful words that will help you practice Spanish when ordering food.

* Quiero - I want, I would like 
* Quiero un jugo de naranja, por favor – I want orange juice, please
* Quiero un café (con leche), por favor – I want a latte, please
* Quiero una cerveza, por favor- I want a beer, please
* Quiero una copa de vino, por favor - I want a glass of wine, please 
* Quiero una copa de vino tinto, por favor – I want a glass of red wine, please
* Quiero una copa de vino blanco, por favor – I want a glass of white wine, please.
* Quiero tacos de carne, por favor. – I want beef tacos, please
* ¿Tienes mantequilla? – Do you have butter?
* La cuenta por favor – The check. please
* ¿Cuánto es? – How much is it?
