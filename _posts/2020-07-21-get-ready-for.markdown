## Meet the Instructors

We’ve enlisted the help of top-rated elementary educators on Wyzant to create powerful, easy-to-follow video sessions using our online learning tool.

In each of their kid-sized lessons, these incredible tutors highlight specific topics that students may have missed when schools closed in the Spring, with focus on important material they need to know. Each lesson is self-contained, with tons of visual aids, guided practice, and, of course, expert instruction.
