It's no secret: technology has made our lives easier. 

We can accomplish different activities by accessing the internet. Things like shopping, training, watching a movie, and learning a language can now be done completely online. Gone are the days when picking up a second (or third, or fourth...) language requires meeting in-person or attending a formal class. In fact, learning Spanish online is an incredibly effective method, and one that more accurately takes into account your own needs, pace, and style of learning than more traditional ones.

Taking online Spanish lessons with the help of a tutor is a positive and viable way to learn Spanish without leaving your home. Still though: first-time language learners have a lot of questions about the best way to learn Spanish online. 

Here are some guidelines to help manage your expectations and set you up for a wonderful first Spanish lesson.

## Finding a Spanish Tutor
Finding the perfect Spanish tutor is the most logical first step to learning Spanish online. There are three aspects to consider to find the right Spanish tutor for you. 

### Background and experience
First, look for a tutor who has a background education and experience teaching Spanish online. Whether they’re a native or non-native Spanish speaker, a well-educated tutor will be prepared to explain specific concepts related to the Spanish language, even if it’s your first time learning any Spanish at all. In addition, an online Spanish tutor will personalize lesson to your needs, and will utilize the appropriate material to guide you. 

### Track record
Second, it is essential to consider the reviews left by previous and/or current students on a Spanish tutor’s profile. A satisfied student will leave a positive review and share the impact of teaching techniques given by their tutor. Moreover, reviews will provide you with a better idea of the tutor’s methods and approach, which can inform your decision.

### Budget
Last but not least, finding a budget-friendly online Spanish tutor is important. These days where bills and expenses have to be paid and the economy can be tight, it might sound difficult to find an affordable online Spanish tutor. However, the good news is that online Spanish tutors are not only experienced, but often affordable. https://www.wyzant.com/Spanish_tutors.aspx


## Assessment
Getting assessed by a Spanish tutor is very important to determine where exactly you and your tutor should begin. A first-time student will focus more on learning the structure of the language, and setting academic goals that will help them learn Spanish. 
Usually occurring at the very first lesson, a Spanish tutor will get to know their student by asking basic questions in Spanish, explaining high-level grammar concepts, taking notes, and engaging in an interactive and friendly manner. A first-time Spanish language assessment is also an excellent opportunity to get to know your teacher better.
After your current level has been determined by your Spanish tutor, they can give more in-depth, honest feedback on grammar, pronunciation, and fluency. Establishing where you should start is pretty important, as both you and your tutor can collaborate on a  specific plan to move you closer to fluency.

## Materials to have on hand
You might be wondering what materials and other resources are essential to have on hand when starting to learn Spanish online. 
A notebook is recommendable to use during the lesson. It might sound like an obvious option; however, this tool is useful to record and review important information from your lessons. The traditional paper notebook never goes out of fashion.
Virtual notes, like those on the Wyzant whiteboard, are also a convenient option for getting the most out of your online Spanish lessons. You can share and compare notes in real-time, and have the advantage of not only taking detailed notes that help put Spanish learning into perspective for you, but to add comments, ask questions, and highlight important information that will be useful at later lessons. 

If there is a specific aspect of the Spanish language that you’re hoping a tutor can clarify, you should expect Spanish homework. Sharing specific documents on grammar, conjugation, pronunciation, vocabulary, or other topics of study will allow the lesson to be more personalized, which leads quickly to fewer doubts, second guesses, and prepares you to advance at a steady pace in your language learning. 
Books and Spanish language dictionaries are a wonderful resource for a first-time Spanish learner, and can serve as reference...but remember: a tutor prepares their lessons in a personalized manner, and will usually direct learning according to your specific goals. Make sure you know what your goals are. 


## Topics of Study
Your first online Spanish lesson will probably focus on important topics to learn how to communicate correctly in Spanish. These topics usually include basic grammar, accents, pronunciation, and conversation.
Grammar is one of the most critical topics when learning any language, especially Spanish. Fundamental rules of clauses, phrases, verbs presented by your Spanish tutor in a clear, detailed, and comprehensive manner are a foundation of language learning. In subsequent lessons, you will follow and comprehend more detailed grammar structures, from essential verbs to more complex yet interesting tenses, Spanish phrases, and sentence structures.
Pronunciation will likely factor greatly into your Spanish learning experience, beginning at the first lesson. If you’ve never encountered it, you’ll probably start by learning the Spanish alphabet, or Spanish greetings, then little by little begin to familiarize yourself with conjugation of verbs and sentence structures.

Your Spanish tutor will help you pronounce different words correctly, and familiarize you with important aspects of Spanish pronunciation. As your fluency level keeps progressing, pronunciation will become part of a discussion of specific subjects and concepts. Personalized Spanish lessons permit each student to practice much pronunciation according to their own level.


Spanish accents marks are usually also presented as part of your first online Spanish lessons. But rather than be presented as a separate subject, they’re taught along with grammar and pronunciation.
Accents in Spanish are essential because they not only determine how a word should be pronounced correctly, but also the meaning of a specific term (especially when writing). Spanish accents will be presented along with different words and phrases, forming a unique picture of the Spanish language.
Conversation is the ultimate goal when learning a language, and Spanish is no exception!. Consequently, even during the first lesson, students usually have the opportunity to communicate based on their own level, using small complete sentences or things they already know. 
A significant advantage of having an online Spanish tutor is that there is an excellent opportunity to communicate and speak Spanish regarding the level of the language. 

## Spanish Visual aids
There might be a misconception that online language lessons are boring. Not true! The truth is that they are engaging, interactive, and very accessible, on top of being affordable and convenient. Online Spanish tutors use different visual aids and other materials to teach the language.  
They vary according to the tutor’s own technique, and the learning needs of their student. Normally, tutors start with prepared documents that can be easily shared on an online whiteboard. Also, virtual notes can be used to clarify any kind of question.
Other useful materials can include pictures, passages from books or other writing, and things like games which help students stay actively participate in making the lesson engaging and entertaining.

## Activities
Activities during online Spanish lessons are engaging and didactic, and pair with the visual material presented by a Spanish tutor. They’re personalized and can vary according to the needs and the level of the student. 
One of the most useful activities is completing grammar exercises, which your tutor will use to help you understand how Spanish grammar is used, how it changes in different contexts, and when the rules are set in stone.
Since Spanish tutoring lessons are always personalized, there are tons of different activities which allow a student to speak, read, write, and understand Spanish while practicing conversation...even from your first lesson! Some examples include introducing yourself, using flash cards or taking quizzes. describing a picture, creating a small story, and other activities that engage you in the active study of Spanish language. 
As lessons and your level of Spanish advance, activities may also grow and change, including more direction to talk about specific subjects, describe complex situations, explain the contents of Spanish articles, and writing your own journal entries or stories.
Of course, since tutoring means you’re taking one on one lessons (and not confined to the classroom, where learning is structured in a way to instruct all students, regardless of their individual levels), you can chat with your tutor to improve a specific area of the Spanish language, solidify your knowledge, or grow at a faster pace.
## Homework time
Homework is a helpful resource to learn any language, and Spanish is no exception. Assignments aren’t what they were in school - forget boring readings and rote memorization. A tutor will allow you to stay engaged with the language by creating homework that addresses your own unique needs and progression. They’ll help with reviewing your work, checking your notes, remembering things you struggled with in past sessions, and practicing grammar, vocabulary, spelling, and pronunciation.
As an online language learner, you’ll have the opportunity to complete the assignment in your own free time, and connect with your tutor to review in preparation for the contents of your next lessons.
The tutor will clarify doubts, correct mistakes, and answer questions, so use your homework in a smart way, to guide your own learning and stay at a comfortable pace.

## Spanish Immersion
The best way to learn Spanish is by immersion in the language. Immersion is a technique used in bilingual language education in which two languages are used for instruction. Becoming immersed helps you get involved in actively using a language, and allows you to practice Spanish as much as possible - both during your online Spanish lessons and afterward.
First-time learners have different opportunities to become immersed in the Spanish language. A tutor will use as much Spanish as possible to communicate. Very useful questions and requests in English are taught, and are instantly replaced by their equivalent in Spanish.
For example, *“Tengo una pregunta,”* (I have a question), *“Como se dice,”* (how do you say), *¿qué es?? (what is...?), *”¿Puedo ir al baño por favor?”* (Can I please use the restroom?), etc.
Since lessons are personalized, Spanish tutor adapt Spanish immersion according to the level of understanding of their student. More intermediate lessons may also include listening activities, specific conversation games, music, and even videos. There is no doubt that first-time learners benefit greatly from the opportunity to practice the language by actually using it.
Spanish tutors also encourage students to continue studying and practicing the language after the class is over. One suggestion may be to practice Spanish immersion by listening to different Spanish podcasts. This exercise helps you identify vocabulary, and - little by little - to understand small phrases. Listening to music and watching shows in Spanish is another way to get immersed in the language and have fun while learning.
Immersion in the language is one of the most successful ways on how to learn Spanish and is sometimes a Spanish tutor’s main goal when teaching the language.

## Being Corrected
If you’re learning any language, including Spanish, expect your tutor to correct you. By listening to how you use the language, identify parts of speech, and engage with material, tutors can offer real-time help while you’re learning, which leads to a deeper mastery of language, since you are not at risk of learning the wrong things. 

Don’t be afraid to speak Spanish, make mistakes, and expect constructive feedback from your tutor.  Errors are part of the language learning process and are actually fundamental for improving communication. Utilize your online lessons as opportunities to communicate as much as possible, even if mistakes might be present!  Rest assured: your tutor will patiently listen, guide you, and make sure that you’re on the right track. 

After the lesson is over, a tutor will give you constructive feedback on aspects of Spanish that may need work before your next lessons. Those specifications may include verb conjugation, sentence structure, genre and number agreement, pronunciation, etc. Take the advice and keep practicing and communicating to improve the language.

## Lesson Pacing
The pace of your lessons will vary according to your level, needs, and progress. Personalized lessons are an extremely effective way or learning Spanish because they allow you to adapt and accommodate to the process based on your own needs and progress. The main goal of any Spanish tutor is for their student to fully understand and easily utilize the language. Consequently, you’ll never feel rushed to complete the material (because it’s created and paced specifically for you).
