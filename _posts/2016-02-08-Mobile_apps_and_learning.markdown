# The mobile revolution.

There’s no doubt smartphones have changed the way we interact with the world, interact with one another, and yes, learn. From the new opportunities we have for students to the immediate connections smart phones allow, it’s an ingenious platform for technology, learning, and lessons. And now we (and our kids) are only seconds away from the next chance to [grow our brains](http://www.brainhq.com/brain-resources/brain-plasticity/what-is-brain-plasticity).

That being said, there's more to consume than there is time for. So we’ve pinpointed the biggest and coolest strides apps have made to the accessibility of education and growth of mental power.


# The Connector: WyzAnt

Yes, our newly released app is first (but that’s because we’re so excited). Now, parents and students can **instantly** connect with a network of 80,000 private tutors. You can filter search results based on what’s most important to you, and easily compare tutors based on ratings, backgrounds, and rates.

Communication within the app is easy and immediate, making scheduling lessons with the largest network in the nation as easy as texting your Mom (maybe easier).

It’s unparalleled access to your child’s next teacher. Someone you choose, and can work with to track progress on a weekly basis while your child steadily grows through the experience of person-to-person learning. All from the chaos of a commute, or the boredom of a waiting room.

# **The Inspiration: TED**

Can you believe what started as a one-time convention is now thousands of on-demand lectures, although the word ‘lecture’ doesn’t do them justice? TED talks are more like pipelines to intelligent conversation. Or looking glasses into worlds we’ve never thought about.

Have a smartphone and an interest? Whether it’s something as tangible as cars, or as abstract as equality, you can count on a TED talk existing about it.

What’s amazing is how the app helps you choose something to learn about when you don’t know what you want to learn about. With its “Inspire Me” tab, you choose videos that are courageous, funny, persuasive, ingenious, jaw-dropping, beautiful, fascinating, informative, or inspiring.

Open up to some incredible stories of people overcoming incredible adversity. If there is **anything** we can learn from, isn’t it that?

# **The Speed Reader: Spritz**

Have you ever been sitting and reading Harry Potter and thought to yourself: If only I could read this faster, I could be on my third go-round already?

Well, it will. And when it does, you might be glad you read this. As much technique as technology, Spritz is a [suite of apps](http://spritzinc.com/get-spritz) that allow you to read all sorts of publications really (really) fast. Like 700\+ words a minute fast.

How’s that work? It probably already hit you from the above gif, but moving eyes across the page slows down your reading.

As for its suite of apps, the two to check out are the Bookshout! and ReadMe! apps, which will get you access to free eBooks, including New York Times Best sellers.

# **The History Catcher: Storycorps**

Storycorps is the second newest addition to this mobile app family (released in 2015 after it’s founder won a $1M TED prize). If you’re not familiar with the [website](https://storycorps.org/) or the [idea](https://www.ted.com/talks/dave_isay_everyone_around_you_has_a_story_the_world_needs_to_hear?language=en), it started as a near never-ending stream of stories from listeners like you and I.

The whole mission is to get people to tell their stories. That’s it. Grandparents, parents, teachers, kids… anyone that has one (and they believe everyone does).

Their, like their mission, is unique. Storycorp collects stories rather than helping you find them—so hit that record button.

It’s nothing short of **archiving life as we know it**. The idea of giving everyone a way to share their stories is Storycorps' way of cataloging the knowledge of generations. Oh, and take a look at [#TheGreatListen](https://storycorps.org/blog/the-great-thanksgiving-listen/), if you haven’t already.

In a world of nearly 2 billion smart phones, access to the internet means access to learning. But more importantly, it’s reframing the way we think about education. And putting the ability to learn anywhere, anytime, right at our fingertips.
