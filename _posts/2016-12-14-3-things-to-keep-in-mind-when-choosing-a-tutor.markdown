So, you’ve decided to hire a tutor—an excellent first step toward reaching your goals. The next step is going to be choosing who exactly to work with. While this task can seem overwhelming, it certainly doesn’t have to be.

By considering your goals ahead of time, asking the right questions and tracking your progress along the way, you’ll ensure that the money and time you devote to working with a tutor is well spent.

Here are three steps to guide you through the process of choosing the best tutor for your learning needs:

### 1. Assess your goals.
Before you begin your search, consider what you hope to gain from your tutoring experience. From logistics and budget to subject matter and teaching methods, putting these goals into words will help you find your perfect match.

Start by asking yourself the following questions:

**What is my availability and budget?**
How often do you envision meeting, and where? Being honest about how much time you can devote to your tutor ahead of time will make your search much easier.

Hectic schedule? [Online tutoring options](https://www.wyzant.com/online/lessonreservation) can help you fit in lessons when they’re convenient for you.

**What type of credentials am I looking for in a tutor?**
[Credentials are important](http://www.greatschools.org/gk/articles/teacher-experience-and-credentials-issues-to-consider/), but so is teaching experience and methodology. Keeping your options open can often help you find the right fit.

**What [type of tutoring](http://www.educationindustry.org/assets/eia-parent-resource-guide.pdf) do I really need?**
Under-perform on a recent test? Struggling to get by at work or in class? You may be looking for remedial subject tutoring, to help you learn and retain a specific set of concepts that are holding you back.

Fighting to keep your head above water in general? You may want a tutor to fill a support role, offering extra help in the most challenging subject areas while providing general support for the duration of a project, semester or school year.

Not feeling challenged enough? You may be seeking enrichment tutoring. An enrichment tutor can help you tackle more advanced subjects outside the classroom or maintain a high level of performance in a course.

Worried about a standardized test on the horizon? Some tutors are specifically trained to help with test preparation and strategy, both to help you increase your scores and reduce the stress of studying.

**What are my expectations?**
Are you expecting to see improvement in grades or scores? More interested in homework help and motivation? A boost in confidence? Want to get that promotion? If you don’t have a time frame for your goals, make sure you set one.

**How would I describe my learning style?**
Consider the styles and strategies that have worked for you in the past, as well as those that haven’t.

### 2. Ask candidates the right questions.
Defining what you’re looking for is the first step. Next you’ve got to find an instructor who matches those needs.

When you’re talking to prospective tutors, you’ll want to quickly assess whether they could be the right fit. Asking these questions will make this part easy.

**What are your qualifications?**
Checking credentials and asking for references is a good first instinct, but Wyzant takes care of that step for you by providing over one million lesson ratings and reviews from former students. Compare profiles to see which ones feel like a match for you.

**What is your availability? How much do you charge?**
To save you the trouble, Wyzant also allows you to [search for and request candidates](https://www.wyzant.com/emailtutor) based on this information. This way you can choose an hourly rate that works with your budget, and book lessons based on your schedule.


**What is your teaching philosophy?**
Depending on the subject matter, you may be interested in a tutor’s approach to breaking down and explaining difficult concepts. Knowing how a tutor plans to approach your sessions can give you an idea of whether their teaching style will match your learning style.

**Why do you tutor?**
If you’d like to get to know a candidate further, this question can help you understand how tutoring fits into their lifestyle, and may give you more insight into their motivation to teach and help others.

### 3. Track your progress.
Once you’ve settled on a tutor you want to work with, the key to developing [a strong working relationship](http://www.edutopia.org/blog/what-makes-a-successful-tutor-seth-linden) will be communication. Make sure your tutor knows what “progress” and “success” mean to you.

Understanding your short and long-term goals will allow you both to focus on the task at hand, and will help your tutor plan their lessons to meet your needs.

### The right tutor is a couple clicks away.
Now that you’ve got the know-how to choose the right tutor, all that’s left to do is begin your search.
