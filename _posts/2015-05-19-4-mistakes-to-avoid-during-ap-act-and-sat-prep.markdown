**Our poor teenagers. With sweaty palms and sharpened pencils, they’re only weeks away from the toughest 4 hours of their school year. Or maybe even their high school careers.**

As parents, we hope the T’s have been crossed, and that 11 years of studying has primed students for their big-time test-taking. But whether it has or it hasn’t—it's out of your hands now.

With the remaining time to test day is a fraction of that, focus on what your child **shouldn’t** be doing. In crunch time, a poor approach to studying expends valuable mental energy. But if your goal is to **remove the barriers to a top-notch study session**, you'll make up ground.

So save you and your child some big pre-exam headaches. And remember:

This is a list of what **NOT** to do (so do the opposite).

# Spend Equal Time Focusing on the Different Parts of the Test

A high-octane approach to test prep builds confidence AND academic knowledge, but with the clock ticking, improving upon weaknesses is most important.

So how do you know what your child’s weaknesses are? And better yet, how do you strengthen them?

1. During every practice test (they are taking practice tests, right?!?), have them star questions they are unsure of the answer to.

2. Collect the wordings of all of these questions into a spreadsheet, even if they guessed the right answer. This eliminates the chance of not working on questions which aren’t fully understood.

3. After the first 1-2 practice tests (students should take 1-1.5 per week), identify the questions that provide the most trouble. Categorize them by test format, and look for patterns and commonly appearing verbs throughout the questions.

4. Rate these categories on a scale of 1 (easiest) to 5 (hardest), according to either total questions missed or the amount of difficulty your child feels with a given type.

Build a practice schedule and revisit this information as you go. The goal? Build good test-taking habits by efficiently managing time each session. Segment out the different difficulties of questions. A good mix is:

* **50% of the time:** Areas needing to be strengthened or aren’t well understand (a 5 on your scale)

* **40% of the time:** Areas that need brushing up on or oft-forgotten items (3)

* **10% of the time:** Areas of strength or confidence builders (1)

# Pick One Practice Exam and Stick to It

The last months before the test should be dedicated to practice test, practice test, practice test (again, 1-1.5 per week). That’s the obvious part. What’s tricky is making sure:

1. The practice exams accurately represent the quality of the test

2. There is a large variation of the phrasing and topics within the information and questions.

If the first criteria isn’t met, there will be knowledge of the concepts and questions, but no exposure to how the questions are phrased on the real test. This could lead to confusion and anxiety on the actual test. If the second criteria isn’t met, practice scores might come out too high. You don't want to rely on memorization of a smaller sample of questions instead of the foundational skills and approaches needed for success.

So where do you find these tests?

When it comes to practice tests representative of the actual test, look to the test makers themselves. Normally, The College Board and ACT (aka the test-makers) only make one practice test available each year. Luckily, we’ve tracked down a few practice tests from previous years below.

* **SAT Prep:** The [Magoosh SAT Blog](https://magoosh.com/hs/sat/2013/full-length-sat-practice-tests/) has PDFs of four College Board versions of the SAT test from the past decade, and we recommend the SAT practice questions currently up on College Board’s website.

* **ACT Prep:** The site [ACT Quantum](http://www.actquantum.com/releasedacttests/) has four different versions of practice tests previously distributed by ACT.

* **AP Prep:** Visit the College Board website for [Sample Questions](http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/exam/exam_information/index.html) and the blog [AP Practice Exams](http://www.appracticeexams.com/ap-physics-b/) for practice materials.

# Treat All Mistakes the Same

Not all wrong answers are created equal. The spreadsheet from the first section will come in handy for additional analysis. Namely, **WHY** questions were answered wrong.

You can boil down the reasons students miss questions into four buckets:

1. **Careless Errors:** The question was misread or the wrong thing was solved for.

2. **Bad Guesses:** Answers were successfully eliminated, but the wrong choice was made between the last two.

3. **Content:** The necessary skills or knowledge for answering the question was missing.

4. **Wrong Approaches:** The knowledge or skills are in place, but a mistake was made in answering.

Each category requires a different step to correct. And being able to identify those steps is priceless. Working with a tutor is an excellent way to refine these abilities. Another approach would be to learn the follow-up questions to ask when one of these errors are made.

## Test-taking Errors and Follow-Up Questions

# Study Until You Drop

When it comes to such high-stakes testing, good study habits can’t only be captured with cliches like “eat breakfast” and “don’t pull all-nighters.” So rather than supply students with timeless verbiage that will go through them like milk through a strainer, explain the rationale of effective habits including:

**1. Taking time to recover:** Most importantly, recognizing learning needs recovery time. Don’t strong-arm your teenager into heavy studying less than 3 days before the test. **Brushing up** on harder material the nights preceding the test is fine, but know information from extensive study sessions won’t stick. Nor is it worth risking energy to stress or exhaustion.

**2. Enforcing a sleep schedule:** Don’t think 8:30 bedtimes the night before the test is the right amount of sleep. Optimal performance requires a sleep **schedule**—like going to sleep every night at the same time for at least a week. These good habits intertwined with a successful study routine will bring brain power to full force on test day.

Need more convincing on the importance of sleep to learning retention? Skim this [Harvard Med](http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/matters/benefits-of-sleep/learning-memory) piece.

**3. Honoring the study location:** As crucial as breaks are to effective study sessions (see this article in [The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/09/science-tells-you-how-many-minutes-should-you-take-a-break-for-work-17/380369/)), so is consistency in where studying takes place. Make it a point to have your child leave the room they study in when they go on breaks. This will keep distractions out of the study space, ensuring extra efficiency.

If nothing else, remember that it’s important to instill a well-thought out study plan. Success on high-stakes SAT and ACT exams isn’t synonymous with endless time locked in a bedroom. By taking an active role in your teen’s study plan and creating efficiencies, you can open the door to significant long-term opportunities. In reality, you could even save money on the cost of tuition!
