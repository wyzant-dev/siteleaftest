**Your teachers lied to you, but it wasn’t on purpose. See what new discoveries we’ve made and what your child will now learn as facts at school.**

### Fact 1: Pluto is a dwarf planet, not a real planet.

Once considered the ninth and most distant planet, Pluto disrupted many children’s styrofoam solar systems in 1979 when it crossed into Neptune’s orbit. Pluto’s elliptical orbit, which changed it to the eighth planet in our system until 1999, was just the beginning of the planet’s troubles. In 2006, Pluto was in the news again after the International Astronomical Union downgraded its status from planet to “dwarf planet”, leaving some of us with dusty grey styrofoam balls that had no place in a reputable solar system model.

So how will your kids learn about the order of planets in school now? Well, they will simply shirk off Pluto from the end of the list, leaving it as Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. As for mnemonic devices, some of us learned “My Very Eager Mother Just Served Us Nine Pickles” or as an alternate it could have been a very educated mother serving nine pizzas. Now, both the pizza and pickles have to go. Lucky for us, eager or educated mothers can just serve nachos and be done with it.

Extra credit: Pluto could make a comeback. If Pluto’s mass is increased, then it could meet the one criteria that it needs to be a planet, which is “[clear the neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearing_the_neighbourhood) around its orbit”. This basically means if Pluto either collides with objects and makes itself larger as a result or is able to push off objects from its orbit then it could become a real planet again.

### Fact 2: Columbus didn’t discover America, but he did make it popular.

Much like spotting a Starbucks in an “undiscovered” vacation spot, Columbus arrived at “undiscovered” America long after others had traveled across the ocean, landed on the continent, and ordered the proverbial Frappuccino.

So who found it first? Well, in 1492, Columbus did indeed sail the ocean blue looking for India, landed on America, and mistook the locals for Indians—but that’s only a portion of the story.

Based on America historical texts and archaeological digs, it’s now believed that Leif Erikson reached America about 500 years before Columbus. What is known for certain is that the Vikings had settlements in Newfoundland (a large Canadian island off the east coast of the North American mainland), and that Leif and his family lived there for several years. There’s also an Irish legend about a group of Irish monks led by Saint Brendan making the journey to America and back in the 6th century.

Though he didn’t find a new path to India, Columbus was able to bring back a lot of gold to his patrons and get everyone in Europe excited about the riches across the sea. His fame and pivotal role in the Age of Discovery did end up having far-reaching effects on both sides of the Atlantic.

Extra credit: Columbus lied to his crew, but only to keep the peace. On his first journey to America, Columbus kept two sets of logs: One told the actual length the ships had travelled in a given day and the other reduced how far the ships had sailed. The latter was shared with the crew who were anxious about travelling for such a long time without seeing land.

### Fact 3: Mauna Kea is the tallest mountain, not Mount Everest.

**“Bigger mountain, I know you’re out there somewhere”**

When it comes to mountains, there is a difference between tallest (length from base to summit) and highest. From top to bottom, Mauna Kea measures 33,465 feet, while Mount Everest is a less impressive 29,029 feet. But Mauna Kea is mostly underwater as it stands only 13,796 ft above sea level, whereas Everest pops out from the Himalayan mountain range.

Extra credit: Speaking of things hiding in the ocean, the world’s tallest mountain range is the mid-oceanic ridge system, which is almost completely underwater.

### Fact 4: Brontosaurus is, no wait, isn’t, wait, now is a type of dinosaur.

**“Hello, is it me you're looking for?”**

Brontosaurus has had a couple of tough decades, fueling fights between two rival paleontologists, the US postal service and the American public. So how did this “Thunder Lizard” end up existing, not existing, and then existing again? In 1879, Othniel Charles Marsh discovered the Brontosaurus. Marsh was one half of the [Copes-Marsh Bone Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_Wars), where sloppy scholarship, ambition, and pettiness pitted two paleontologists against each other, with each one trying to publish more articles than his rival without always checking the details.

By the early 1900s, most scientists agreed that the Brontosaurus and Apatosaurus were in fact the same genus, which meant the older name of Apatosaurus would prevail. However, it wasn’t until the mid-1970s that the Brontosaurus met its end and was no longer included in most school books. Then in 1989, the [US postal stamp with a brontosaurus](http://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/18/us/use-of-extinct-name-rattles-dinosaur-lobby.html) caused a controversy for people who care about scientific inaccuracies being purported by government agencies.

In April 2015, an article published in the scientific Journal PeerJ brought Brontosaurus back into the fold as its own genus, and opened the doors to potentially finding more types of sauropods.

Extra credit: Think all dinosaurs are mostly big lizards? Well, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, a dinosaur beloved by movie-goers, toy-makers, and meme-makers for its small arms and gnashing of prey, is actually [more closely related to a chicken or ostrich than a lizard](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/04/080424-trex-mastodon.html).

### Fact 5: We now have five oceans, not four.

![facts5.jpg](/blog/uploads/facts5.jpg)

Most of us were taught that the Arctic, Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific were the world’s oceans. But the Southern Ocean is now a real thing and takes the fifth seat. In 2000, the name was chosen by member states of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) who were able to stem the tide for calling it the “Antarctic Ocean”.

Extra credit: The deepest part of the ocean explored by humans is the Mariana Trench, which is known to go almost eight miles below sea level.
