Studying can be challenging, and going at it alone—especially with a difficult subject or daunting test—[can make the burden feel even heavier](http://www.princetonreview.com/high-school/student-life-american-teens). Whether it’s tackling a new course, memorizing chemical compounds or struggling to beat the clock on an upcoming exam, there’s a point at which studying on your own can stop being helpful. You may even be [setting yourself back](http://college.usatoday.com/2014/01/14/6-study-habits-that-could-be-hurting-your-grade/) with study habits that could hinder your progress.

As a student or working professional, you’re likely juggling a lot of responsibilities, and free resources like workplace training or a school’s study center may not be enough.

This is the moment when you can start thinking about finding an expert to help—someone who can reroute you down a more efficient path to reaching your goals.

Ask yourself these five questions when considering working with a private tutor:

### 1. Do I have the time to figure this out on my own?
Sometimes, there simply aren’t enough hours in the day to check off everything on your to-do list. That’s where time management and prioritization come in.

A tutor can help you manage your time by making your study habits more efficient, and by assessing your workload to determine priorities based on your goals.

Do you already have a study group or class materials that are working for you? Have you carved out time in your schedule dedicated to learning? Maybe you’re already seeing the improvement you want to see—but if not, working 1-to-1 with a tutor is a smart way to get where you want to be.

### 2. Am I on track with my goals?
Determine what you want to accomplish, and when you want to see results. This will help you assess whether or not you’re on the right trajectory, and if hiring a tutor would be beneficial.

As a student or working professional, seeking out a tutor—[both to help you excel and to stay ahead of the pack](http://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/2012/march/why-top-students-hite-tutors/)—can help you track your progress and keep yourself accountable throughout the learning process.

### 3. Do I study better alone or with a partner?
Psychological studies, educational testing and teacher testimonials have long supported the idea that [personality impacts learning style](http://www.edutopia.org/multiple-intelligences-research). One way traditional classrooms fail to cater to these differences is a bias towards independent study. Studies show that many [students simply do better together](http://www.edutopia.org/inquiry-project-learning-research), in groups or with someone helping them out.  

Knowing what kind of learner you are can help you create your own ideal learning plan. If you’ve discovered that you thrive when working on your own, you might want to schedule solo study sessions. If you find that you work better with others, seeking out a private tutor might be the best choice for you.

### 4. Do I have other options?
Free resources can be a great first resort when you’re looking to clear a subject-related hurdle or jumpstart a stalled study plan. Consider the following options as you’re looking for extra help:

* [Many schools and campuses](http://www.academicinfo.net/campus-life/smart-students-take-full-advantage-of-campus-resources) have study centers devoted to both undergraduates, graduates and adult learners. These centers are often staffed by students and faculty who are willing to answer questions, offer study tips and look over assignments.
* [Asking a teacher for extra help](https://signeteducation.com/blog/asking-for-help) is always a good idea, especially if you’re struggling with a specific concept or assignment. Plus, they may already have an established study group you can join.
* [Local libraries, community colleges and adult learning centers](http://www.ed.gov/oii-news/better-use-community-resources) sometimes offer homework help, free access to online learning services and other forms of community-based academic support.
* [Online learning games](http://edtechreview.in/news/834-best-educational-websites-and-games-for-high-school-students), mobile apps and other software can help you hone your skills in specific subjects, often while having fun and competing digitally with other players. These types of games are especially popular with language learners.

If you’ve tried some of these resources and don’t think they offer you the targeted help and personalized attention you need, a professional tutor might be your best choice.

### 5. Can I afford it?
If finances are top of mind for you as a student, you can browse for tutors by their hourly rate. At Wyzant, you won’t pay a thing until your lesson is complete, so it’s completely free to search for and contact tutors. Depending on what you need and can afford, it’s highly likely that there will be a tutor nearby or online who can meet your individual needs.

Tutors are far more useful, affordable and flexible than some may realize. The challenge is finding the right fit. Wyzant gives you instant access to qualified, vetted instructors who can help, no matter where you live, or how busy your schedule is. Whether you’re looking for in-person or online lessons, we can help you find the 1-to-1 help you need to reach your goals.
