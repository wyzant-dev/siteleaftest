Consider the following scenario:
 
Jack and Jill went up a hill, but they had 6 friends at the bottom of the hill, at least 2 of whom but no more than 4 of whom followed them up the hill… And apparently, they all had plenty of water, so they instead went up the hill to go to a conference. Each conference attendee presented on exactly 1 of the following 3 topics: the meaning of life, topography, and the difficulty of coming up with examples. Also, each person’s presentation either included visual props or did not.
 
In all fairness, the above is a bit absurd, even for the LSAT Analytical Reasoning section - more commonly referred to as the Logic Games section (LG). For many LG is initially the most difficult but ultimately the most improvable of the 3 kinds of LSAT multiple-choice sections: it’s foreign to the vast majority of those preparing for the LSAT and so most students start far back on what can be a steep learning curve. Thankfully, given that LG is based purely on deduction, it can by some definitions be considered mathematics and accordingly can be mastered more easily with intensive practice than can something like the Reading Comprehension section. Here’s a breakdown of how to tackle LG:

## Start simply
 
LG accounts for only 1 of the 4 scored sections of the LSAT, and given that it generally contains 23 questions, it actually contributes the least to your score of the 3 kinds of LSAT sections. If that’s new information for you, please feel free to check out some [LSAT prep tips](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/how-to-study-for-the-lsat/) and our guide to [LSAT Writing](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/lsat-writing/), as each would help you round out your knowledge of the test. Every LG section ever released has contained 4 games, each with its own constraints / conditions / rules to understand, along with a set of questions of varying difficulty. As previously addressed, LG operates entirely by deduction, meaning every answer can be attained with 100% certainty. While appearances can certainly vary, it’s well-noted that LG is highly predictable in nature, with certain types recurring from test to test.
 
Some games ask you to decide what places runners took in a race, or when certain flights will arrive at an airport, and these games are referred to as linear / ordering / sequencing games. As we’ll touch on a bit later, there are differences in terminology between prep companies, but the essential structures are the same.
 
Other games ask you to position your “game pieces” - those people, places or things to be organized - into different groups; these games are sensibly referred to as grouping games.
And then there are several other game types, such as those that combine various elements (known as “hybrids” of one variation or another), plus some rare types like “mapping”.
 
Regardless of how you eventually choose to categorize games, you’ll almost certainly need to be able to reliably make diagrams, visual representations of how the game works. And to do so, you’ll need to identify the diagramming methods that suit you, practice utilizing them and finally memorize them. This identification, practice, and eventual memorization in turn requires a systematic way of thinking – something vital to [law school success](https://www.wyzant.com/law_tutors.aspx). Let’s take a look at some of the means available to get you thinking correctly about LG.

## Experiment with and sort through some excellent resources
 
It can be a bit daunting to try to navigate the LSAT prep landscape: there are loads of books, and many courses are out there as well, some live and others online. For those of you who have looked at prep materials for LG from more than 1 source, you’ve likely noticed some differences between them, likely in both terminology used and methods endorsed. These differences can be a major source of confusion, so it’s vital to take some time to craft a plan to effectively attack LG, and working with a well-qualified [LSAT tutor](https://www.wyzant.com/LSAT_tutors.aspx) can help tremendously in achieving that goal.
 
Here are some of the best tools you can use to hone your skills on LG, listed in alphabetical order, with some points regarding the resource type and its advantages:
 
### 7Sage LSAT
Online | Sizable Core Curriculum & Top-notch video explanations
 
[7Sage](https://7sage.com/) offers a fully digital experience and has a thorough Core Curriculum (CC), some of which is devoted to LG, and their methods are highly intuitive and “neat”. Their enormously beneficial LG video explanations, which were freely available on YouTube until November 2019, are currently available within all but the least expensive of their 4 paid packages.
 
### LSAT Lab
Online | Easy-to-use interface & Innovative filtering system
 
[LSATLab](https://lsatlab.com/lsat/) also offers a fully digital experience and provides both video and written explanations - the extent of which depends on the package someone selects. You can test things out by taking a free diagnostic test on their site under the Starter plan - maybe after trying out some of their free practice questions. LSATLab also has an interesting approach to labeling questions by concepts tested.
 
### The LSAT Logic Game Bible
Book | Highly detailed work covering the ins and outs of LG
 
Written by David M. Killoran, the [LG bible](https://www.powerscore.com/lsat/) dives deep into LG, going to great lengths to provide the reader with a solid understanding of the concepts at play. This PowerScore book is structured carefully, progressing in difficulty from one chapter to the next, and the approaches are consistent because they build on themselves. Also, regarding the edition, anything dated within the past 5 years (first edition was published in 2001!) would be fine.
 
### The LSAT Trainer
Book | Comprehensive work with great sections on LG
 
Written by Mike Kim, [the Trainer](http://www.thelsattrainer.com/) is one of the most highly reviewed LSAT books on the market, and for good reason: the book does a great job of covering the essentials of the LSAT, and as far as content geared toward LG goes, the conditional statement drills included in the book go hand in hand with the LG specific sections. Mike also has free sample chapters available on his website.
 
Now, the above is of course very far from an exhaustive list of LG resources, as companies like BluePrint LSAT Prep, LSATMax, Manhattan Prep and TestMasters, along with several others, bring additional value to the table. But the list should give you an idea of what you can use to supplement the work you do with your tutor. The crucial thing to nail down with a tutor, 1-on-1, is to figure out the LG learning tools that fit your budget, timeline, and learning style.
 
## Discover where you fall along the spectrum of diagramming
 
Jot down the big things and get moving. This is the “minimalist” approach to LG diagramming: get a general grasp of a game, make a master game board, and then hit the questions. The success of this approach relies heavily on a test-taker’s ability to make inferences later on and develop question-specific diagrams.
 
Write more now and think less later. This is the “maximalist” approach to LG diagramming: take a lot of time up front to break into various possibilities before even starting the questions. These possibilities go by several different names depending on where you look: limited options, game boards, scenarios, templates, worlds, etc. Some maximalists (no idea who that could include) may even create 6 to 8 possible layouts for a game before moving to the questions!
 
Students typically move from the “minimalist” end to the “maximalist” end of the spectrum over the course of their prep, as they realize the value of early time investment, the same mode of investment that tends to pay off on [LSAT Logical Reasoning](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/lsat-logical-reasoning/). But plenty of people at different points along the spectrum manage to go perfect on LG every [LSAT administration](https://www.lsac.org/lsat/lsat-dates-deadlines-score-release-dates/registering-lsat). As discussed, experiment to find what works well for you, and then put the work in to see results.
 
## Understand the value of both timed and untimed work
 
Depending on how many questions you tend to miss over a properly timed Logic Games section, the ratio of timed to untimed work you should target during a given week of prep can range significantly, and how much time you have to prepare (ideally > 3 months) can also affect that ratio.
 
Timed work includes any game or part of a game done in a manner that involves ANY timing: a game done as part of a full-length practice test, as part of a section, as a stand-alone (perhaps done with a time goal in mind), etc. Untimed work, on the other hand, includes any game or part of a game done in a manner that involves NO timing; all review work should fall into this category.
 
For the sake of simplicity, we’ll take as an example a student who 1) has studied for 2 months and has 4 months of study remaining, 2) has taken 5 full-length [LSAT practice tests](https://familiar.lsac.org/) (PTs) and 3) has worked on about 16 games - some under proper time constraints and some not - outside of those included within the taken PTs. By considering the average # of questions missed across all realistically done games, we can approximate the ratio of timed to untimed work that student should be doing over the next week of his/her LSAT prep:
 
| Average # of questions missed   	| Ratio of timed to untimed work   	| % timed     	|
|:-------------------------------:	|:--------------------------------:	|-------------	|
|             10 to 13            	|               1 : 4              	| 20.0% timed 	|
|              7 to 9             	|               2 : 3              	| 40.0% timed 	|
|              4 to 6             	|               3 : 1              	| 75.0% timed 	|
|              2 to 3             	|              17 : 3              	| 85.0% timed 	|
|              0 to 1             	|               9 : 1              	| 90.0% timed 	|
 
The above assumes our student is scoring at least 10/23 on LG – a fair assumption since we stated he/she has already spent 2 months studying. Putting aside the exact values chosen, the takeaway is this: the more accurate you are, the higher the percentage of timed work you should be doing on LG. Now, even at the uppermost level (occupied by those averaging at most 1 error), a decent percentage of study time still goes to untimed work because detailed review work should ALWAYS be included as a main part of someone’s prep. You can also notice that the biggest percentage point increase, between 40% and 75%, occurs when someone gets to the point where he/she is missing about a “game’s worth” of questions: that’s the opportune time to dial up the speed work.
 
## Focus on memorization, precision, and repetition
 
You should memorize how to work through games by [perfecting your ability to make inferences](https://7sage.com/how-to-get-a-perfect-score-on-the-logic-games/). LG rewards precision and punishes (usually harshly) a lack thereof. You’ll need to be patient and acknowledge the necessity of high volume to reach your potential on LG. Old games (which include at least those games from LSAT PrepTests 1 thru 29) can be a great asset when you’re trying to get in a large amount of volume.
 
## Bonus tips (for those on the advanced side, i.e., those regularly going -0 to -3 on LG)
 
### Specifically drill “rule substitution” questions
 
“Rule substitution” questions frequently account for 1 question per LG and - while difficult and time consuming - can make the difference between landing above a [T14 school’s median LSAT score](https://7sage.com/top-law-school-admissions/) or not. Unfortunately, there aren’t a bunch of rule sub questions with which to practice, but you can focus on a dozen or so and repeat the solving process to become more efficient and thus confident come test day.
 
### Gradually cut down your allotted time
 
By allowing yourself only 34.5 minutes per section, 34 minutes per section, and so on until you get down to 32 minutes per section, or even less if you’re still managing to go -0 to -1, you’ll be able to increase the chance that the increased stress on test day WON’T throw off your performance. Once you notice your accuracy starting to slip, take some time to work at that time level, and then continue to press for additional speed if and when you get back on target.
 
### Cherry pick (as applicable) and then redo some of the most difficult games ever released.
 
You should start by finding the one with dinosaurs roaming through the sub zones of zones 1, 2, and 3 in an attempt to track the spread of a computer virus… If you recognized the 3 game topics in that ridiculous description, then you’re likely a candidate for redoing those games - and ones like them - to max out your LG score. If you didn’t, then no worries, as you can encounter the dinosaurs on LSAT PrepTest 57, the sub zones on LSAT PrepTest 67, or the computer virus on LSAT PrepTest 79.
