# "You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon? It's the ship that made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs." ― Han Solo

Han Solo’s boast will forever live in astronomical infamy. Partially because of the off-the-wall [time travel theories](http://www.wired.com/2013/02/kessel-run-12-parsecs/) we’ve extrapolated from it, but mostly for George Lucas’ mistaking of time and distance.

If you’ve ever stopped to ask what a parsec is, you know it’s a unit of distance. To be exact:

**1 parsec = 3.26 light-years = 19 trillion miles**

Basically, parsecs are what scientists use to find the distance of stars within 100 light years of our solar system.

But how is this seemingly infinite distance used? And how do scientists (or time-traveling smugglers) calculate it. Believe it or not, with some high school math, we can calculate it.

# Parallax and an Arcsecond Walk into a Classroom...

The term parsec is a combination of two words: **Parallax** and **Arcsecond**.

We need to know both of these to calculate a parsec, because **one arcsecond of parallax is one parsec**.

You’re already familiar with **parallax**, but not for measuring distance. When you hold a thumb at arm's length and close one eye, then close the other, the thumb moves against the background. That’s the parallax effect. And believe it or not, the stars change slightly in the sky when looked at from different places (like at different times in Earth's orbit).

**Arcseconds** will conjure up the ghosts of geometry. Remember how any circle has 360 degrees? Well, every degree is made up of 60 arcminutes, and each arcminute has 60 arcseconds. It’s like the astronomer’s equivalent of those plastic protractors from middle school.

**Don’t Forget:** When we look up, we only see 180° of the sky. The other half can’t be seen because it’s below the horizon.

# Step 1: Measure the arcseconds

Because our eyes are too close and stars are too far away, we have to use some trickery to notice a parallax. By taking a picture of a star, waiting six months, and then taking another one on the other side of the sun, scientists (or amateur astronomers like us) can see how far a star shifted compared to other stars in the sky.  

While it’s possible (and a great way to look at constellations) to measure degrees in the sky [with just your fingers or fist](http://oneminuteastronomer.com/860/measuring-sky/), the distances stars move are too small to measure this way. For example, holding your pinky finger at arm’s length is roughly a degree, but in six months, no star will even shift by an arcminute (1/60th of a degree). The closest star to us is Proxima Centauri, and it only moves .77 arcseconds when measured from either side of the sun!

So what do scientists use? Telescopes, some of which let them see views of one degree or less. Some telescopes can resolve down to about one arcsecond.

So let’s say Solo is making a stop on Earth before shipping off towards a star that moves a distance (or has a parallax) of 0.36 arcseconds when we take the two pictures six months apart.

# Measuring the sky by hand

A thumb and four fingers can be a useful tool for amateur astronomers to measure the night sky. When holding your hand at arm's length against the night sky, your hands tell you how many degrees one star is from the next:

* The width of a fist spans 10°
* Three middle fingers are approximately 5°
* Your pinky at arm’s length is roughly 1°

# Step 2: Calculate the Distance

Now the math. We can use the shape of a triangle to set up a calculation. Combining our parallax angle and another distance we already know gives us all we need to know about our triangle:

* The bottom edge (and the shortest side) of the triangle is the distance from the sun to the Earth: 1 AU (93 million miles).
* The angle at the opposite end of the triangle is the parallax (.36 arcseconds).

But, wait...

We need to cut our parallax in half to get the right measurement. Why?

*Because we measured the parallax angle from either side of the sun, which means that we were 1 AU away from the sun on opposite sides (so the bottom of our triangle with 0.36 arcseconds is 2 AU but should be 1 AU). So the parallax is twice what it’s supposed to be.*

When we cut the parallax in half, we get our REAL parallax angle: 0.18 arcseconds. And since we know one arcsecond of parallax is one parsec, the rest is easy. We divide 1 by the parallax (0.18) to get a distance of 5.55 parsecs.

But shouldn’t it be 0.18 parsecs since one arcsecond of parallax is equal to one parsec? Actually, the further away a star is, the smaller its parallax will be (that's why we divide by 1).

And if Han wanted to know how many light years, or miles, those 5.55 parsecs would be? Do the Math!

**For Comparison...**

* New York to Los Angeles: 2790 miles
* The circumference of Earth: 24901 miles
* Circumference of the sun: 2,713,406 miles
* Average distance between Earth and Mars: 140,000,000 miles
* Distance to the sun: 93,000,000 miles
* Distance between the sun to Pluto: 3.66 billion miles (0.00019 parsecs)
* Distance across the Milky Way: 30,675 parsecs

There are 90 stars within 12 parsecs of our solar system. The most distant bright star in the night sky, Deneb, is about 1500 light years (460 parsecs) away from Earth.

**Bonus question:** If the Millenium Falcon made the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs but Han Solo wasn't the pilot, how many miles would that be?
