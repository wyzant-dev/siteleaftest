## A look at any family calendar will reveal one common truth: we’re all capital B Busy. Between jobs, school, after school activities and homework, creating your family calendar can feel like you’re manning the control tower at JFK.

Adding tutoring lessons to the mix may sound daunting at first—after all, it’s just another thing to work into the schedule. But, by incorporating online lessons, it’s likely you’ll find that it fits in easily with the schedule you’ve already set up. Across the country, students and families have found different formulas for making online tutoring a successful part of their routine. We’ll look at how they’re using it, when they’re using it, and how it’s helping them maintain learning momentum to help you successfully “plug it in” to your routine.

### Needs-based

Needs-based sessions fall under two umbrellas: planned and unplanned.

Family vacations and other travel are commonly planned disrupters of tutoring. For those on winter break or taking summer trips, online tutoring can keep students engaged in learning, and provide an instant remedy for “brain drain." Online lessons gives your student the chance to flex those brain muscles no matter where they are.

#### "What's more comforting than sending a text and knowing your student will be well-prepared before bedtime?"

Online tutoring also offers a solution when circumstances arise that are out of anyone’s control. Things inevitably pop-up—car troubles, off-the-cuff appointments, and anything mother nature decides to throw our way. With online tutoring, your child can still get homework help they need.

### Distance

These lessons either start online and continue online, or start in-person and evolve to online.

Students looking for help in a subject with lower demand or living in a less-populated area find it beneficial to explore options outside of your geographic radius. Even in densely populated cities, online is a go-to option for families whose time is too constrained to commute. A good example would be those without cars (or enough of them), but who aren’t yet ready to have their students meet with a tutor in-home.

Better yet, distance lessons are life-savers if a tutor relocates or your student goes off to college. Introducing that distance doesn’t have to mean the start of a new search and the end of the fruitful relationship that’s helped your student progress to peaks you’d never thought possible.

### Last-second/Refresher

It doesn’t matter whether it’s high-stakes testing or a pop quiz, the most used application for online might be as a live study guide. In other words, it’s the kind of thing you don’t know if you’ll need until you need it. Like the inevitable moment when your student looks over materials in the days before a test, only to find a gap in the understanding of a critical concept.

But the biggest dividend of last-second lessons is the way they relieve test anxiety. Assurance from someone who has learned exactly how to talk to your child is the boost in confidence that can make all the difference. As a parent, what's more comforting than sending a text and knowing your student will be well-prepared before bedtime?

### Co-working

Many tasks can be completed online without having to be personally present with a tutee. Co-working serves as a great way to reinforce concept and review—making this a great supplement that saves everyone from the hassles of commuting and scheduling.

For writing, both outlining and editing essays are examples of online assistance that can be used instead of sitting across the table. The Wolfram Alpha tool found within Wyzant’s online platform means students can do guided research, where tutors offer suggestions and understand their thought process. Changing word selections and correcting grammatical errors are also concrete tasks that can be performed online.

When it comes to math and science, the online tool provides ideal support for troublesome homework problems and test review. Students can scan and upload tests, and walk-through problems without leaving their own home.

### Remember...

These four scenarios aren’t mutually exclusive. Plenty of tutors and students work together both online and in-person, working in unison to meet the needs of the student.
