## Alas (and yippie!), the 2016 Wyzant Scholarship contest has come to an end.

Starting in October of last year, nearly 9,000 students put their pens to paper (or fingers to keyboards) and shared their biggest inspirations with us. The result was thousands of amazing essays from students of all ages.

So as sad as we are to say goodbye to the 2016 Scholarship Contest, we’re ecstatic to announce our three winners of the $15,000 in scholarships as they move on to the next stages of their education.

Thanks to everyone who applied, and the friends, family and tutors who empowered them every step of the way. Here are [the winning essays](https://www.wyzant.com/scholarships/winners), and if that’s not enough, we even had some profound quotes roll in with this year’s submissions.

## First Place: Kate

**Essay Title:** “My Mom’s Escape”
In the fall, Kate will be heading from her hometown of Winnetka, Calif., to Northern California where she’ll be attending San Jose State. Inspired by her mother and grandfather, she’s choosing to major in applied mathematics.

## Second Place: Chenoa
