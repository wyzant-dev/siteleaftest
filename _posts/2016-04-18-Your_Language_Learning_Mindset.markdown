## By the time I graduated high school, and after hours of poring over all things Spanish, I was fluent.

That was in complete contrast to another, not-so-successful, endeavor during high school: Piano. I started lessons in the third grade and continued for nine years. But somewhere along the way, my skills and enthusiasm flatlined. In college, I met dozens of people who could not only play but also compose songs of their own. I felt I'd squandered my years of lessons. And I regretted it.

The good thing is: It's never too late to start again. And the key to success is having a smart approach. Now when I compare my piano skills against my Spanish skills, I see what was missing.

Here’s what I learned should be a part of any new learner’s mentality.

## A Sense of Purpose

Without a purpose, it's like spinning your wheels and getting nowhere. With it, you can make great self-discoveries and countless friends.

As a mediocre piano player, I knew I'd never do anything professionally. If only I'd realized I could play for friends, make my own music, and use the art in my daily life. Likewise, it’s hard to quantify all the opportunities you’ll have to use your new language. But as you start to build this list, you’ll find it invigorating for your studies.

## A Solid Foundation

By foundation, I mean taking the pronunciation of your ABC’s seriously from the beginning. Get a good dictionary and always look up (and write down) new words. Don’t be sloppy with matching your adjectives and nouns. Grammar is an important part of a foundation and, in some ways, **it’s inseparable from speaking ability.**

My ability to absorb new words grew exponentially after this initial painstaking (yet fun) process.

## The Thirst for Assessment

Always take stock of your progress. It helps to have a teacher point out your weaknesses and strengths. At the same time, don't mind any ridicule from your family and friends. They have no idea how much you'll blossom.

## Patience and Belief

Your skills will take time to manifest. Native and non-native speakers alike tend to be skeptical of a new speaker’s ability. It can make your mouth dry and make you speak awkwardly, just as they imagined. But there will also be big encouraging moments. And there's nothing like encouragement to make you soar.

## Bonus: Passion

In contrast to piano, anything remotely Spanish would brighten my eyes. I could look up words for hours on end and not get tired.

There are, of course, dozens of shades of fluency, and you never stop learning. The way we see ourselves (e.g. as a “mediocre” speaker) and the reasons we take on something have a powerful impact on the results we get.
