“What does peace mean to you?”

That’s the question that Alexandrea Newell has been asking for years. So far she’s asked it in 25 different countries to people from different ethnicities, religions, and upbringings.

She’s compiling the answers into a book, one she began working on in 2010. Long before conceiving her own discipline of Art Therapy (known as Eco Art Therapy), or writing her Master’s Thesis, or even obtaining her Bachelor’s.

For a college experience, it’s as atypical as they come. And few could have guessed what it would have induced.

# Staying Positive

Alexandrea has always stood out. But there was a time when that hurt more than it helped.

In middle school, she often felt like an outsider. Alexandrea became a very good writer, something she turned to after her father passed away when she was 15. She became so good, in fact, that a few of her teachers wrongly accused her of plagiarizing.

But looking back, the adversity allowed her to get an outside perspective, she says. She realized there was no way to truly please others, and accepted the challenge of being her own guide.

As she went further down that road, she began to see problems as challenges, and to highlight the bright spots in her past rather than dwell on the dark ones.

“Every problem is a challenge,” she says. “Every dark unexplored corner of the world and the human psyche is a place to enter.”

# Finding Her Own Voice

It wasn’t until she was a Junior in college that Alexandrea entered the WyzAnt scholarship contest. She was hoping to apply the scholarship to her studies at Marquette University, where she was double majoring in Psychology and Journalism.

She’d already done a Semester at Sea—a floating university which takes students across the globe for a semester—and gotten the idea for her book because of it. She’d even earned other scholarships. But winning the WyzAnt contest was different—and not just because it was the last.

It helped her to find her voice.

“When I was writing as a senior in high school, it was dreams and aspirations,” says Alexandrea. “Writing as a senior in college, I realized that I was starting to have my own voice and be a force that people would listen to.”

# Making the Most of Experiences

As that voice grew louder, Alexandrea began to flourish. She pursued a Master’s in Art Therapy after finishing up at Marquette. For her, it was a natural evolution. Art therapy, through writing, had been a powerful tool for her in high school.

So she began to share it.

She’s crossed various forms of art therapy. She worked with dance movement, helping kids who’d experienced trauma find therapy through dance. She’s worked with visual arts and holistic healing and nature centers. Later, she even traveled to a rural community in Nicaragua. Her goal? Create positive and uplifting messages through murals and other art.

Her latest turn comes on the wings of all her experiences—the adversity, the empowered voice, and the learning. And a 200-page thesis later, Eco Art Therapy (using the environment to create art) is taking flight.

And as she’s done time and again, Alexandrea looked into her past to make the future brighter.

“Eco came from my dad. He said the answers that I needed are in the woods, and I think that’s emerged again as I’ve been doing some soul searching.”

# Alexandrea's Essay Tip...

"I looked to my community who has always been so supportive. There are so many platforms to reach out on, even Facebook can be a powerful tool for sharing your message. I put my work on Facebook and people I hadn’t talked to in years shared it and voted. The ripple effect is amazing."
