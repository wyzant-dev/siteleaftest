There’s good news and bad news about LSAT Writing.

The good news: LSAT test-takers (probably you or soon to be you) no longer must complete a writing sample shortly after 5 LSAT multiple choice sections. They now get to complete LSAT Writing up to a full year after their test date and on their own terms (of course with various rules to follow).

The bad news: a higher standard of writing will likely be expected given that test-takers may now optimize or at least try to optimize outside factors (time of day, location, temperature, chair type, lighting...alright I’ll stop now).

Thankfully, with this guide and the help of an [expert LSAT tutor](https://www.wyzant.com/LSAT_tutors.aspx), you’ll have a much easier time reaching your peak LSAT Writing performance.
 
We’ll break things down in this guide under the following 5 headings:

1. 10 basic facts about LSAT Writing
2. Some additional points to consider
3. General directions for the LSAT decision-prompt
4. Top recommendations on how to do your best
5. An example for you to try on your own

## 1. 10 basic facts about LSAT Writing

<br />

- It’s a 35-minute assignment.
 
- Completion of the assignment is a law school requirement: you must submit at least one writing sample before your “Law School Report” (the profile which combines your academic records, test scores, letters of recommendation, etc.) may be sent to any law school.
 
- The assignment need only be completed once! This certainly beats the old way the LSAT writing sample was done: test-takers had to complete the assignment even if they had already done so at the end of a previous [LSAT administration](https://www.lsac.org/lsat/lsat-dates-deadlines-score-release-dates/registering-lsat).
 
- As acknowledged at the top of this article, [law school](https://www.wyzant.com/law_tutors.aspx) hopefuls have one year from their test date to complete a writing sample, but I believe getting it done within 2 weeks after your test is ideal.
 
- Related to the above point, LSAC claims that it may take about a month to process your LSAT Writing assignment, so you should keep that in mind when planning out timing for your law school applications. Control what you can to make the application process as seamless as possible.
 
- You don’t need to do LSAT Writing if you have a writing sample on file from a paper-based test (so the June 2019 LSAT, AKA LSAT PrepTest 87, or an earlier LSAT), but just in case you’d like another go, you have the option to register for LSAT Writing (at additional cost).
 
- Law schools to which you’re applying will receive your 3 most recent writing samples (as applicable).
 
- The assignment is NOT scored! Your 120-180 scaled score on the LSAT is determined by and ONLY by your performance on the 4 of 5 multiple choice sections that are scored. Check out some useful [LSAT prep tips](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/how-to-study-for-the-lsat/) to maximize your performance on those sections.
 
- From 2 options, you’ll be tasked with choosing which you believe best satisfies stated criteria and making a case as to why, but there will NOT be a clear winner. There’s no pressure to make “the right choice”.
 
- The assignment is given different weight at different law schools. Yes, that’s imprecise, but it’s helpful to keep in mind that the admissions committee at your dream law school may be one that DOES carefully read LSAT Writing assignments; be on the safe side and prep accordingly!

## 2. Some additional points to consider

As we just addressed, you can’t be certain as to which law schools carefully read writing sample submissions, which means you’re best served by assuming the quality of your time-constrained essay will work as a key indicator of your ability to write well under pressure: an ability vital to law school success. Treat LSAT Writing as an opportunity to showcase your ability to examine presented facts and articulate your position.
 
Given the digital interface used, you’ll need access to a computer that runs Windows or Mac OS, which thankfully covers the majority of prospective writers. But the following are also required:

* a monitor
* a webcam
* a microphone
* a reliable internet connection

It would be advisable to test out the proctoring software in advance and try things out on the LSAC site. Keep in mind that LSAC’s interface will offer at least the following features:

* cut/copy/paste
* spell-check (sigh of relief)
* line reader
* speech-to-text functionality

Security is strict: the platform is designed to monitor your hardware to ensure you’re not cheating. There’s a video check-in process; a government-issued ID and display of your workspace to the camera are both required. Internet-based applications that could offer an unfair advantage will be blocked and your actions will be recorded and reviewed by proctors to ensure adherence to the rules provided.

## 3. General directions for the LSAT decision-prompt

LSAC states the following:
 
“You will have 35 minutes in which to plan and write an essay on the topic provided [it will be a randomly selected prompt]. Read the topic and the accompanying directions carefully. You will probably find it best to spend a few minutes considering the topic and organizing your thoughts before you begin writing. In your essay, be sure to develop your ideas fully, leaving time, if possible, to review what you have written. Do not write on a topic other than the one specified. Writing on a topic of your own choice is not acceptable.
 
No special knowledge is required or expected for this writing exercise. Law schools are interested in the reasoning, clarity, organization, language usage, and writing mechanics displayed in your essay. How well you write is more important than how much you write.”

## 4. Top recommendations on how to do your best

### Make use of your resources

You’re permitted scratch paper. You can and should use it to outline your essay. I recommend taking 4 minutes to read, think and map out your ideas, 27 minutes to write and another 4 minutes to proofread and adjust as you see fit. I’d say that, unless your writing style gives you good reason to stray from those targets, you should aim to be +/- 1 on all of them.
 
### Pay attention to detail

You will see a second set of directions near the actual essay topic. These are more specific, so make certain you take the necessary time to understand them before you start writing, as doubling back would be a waste of time. In line with what tends to work best on the LSAT’s multiple choice sections, including the LSAT Logical Reasoning sections, up front time investment is likely to pay off.
 
### Focus on how to frame given information

Law schools care about how well you can utilize given information to establish a position that conforms to stated criteria. You don’t need to know about fish farming (fine - that’s actually from the RC of LSAT PrepTest 88) or whatever else the topic happens to be. You also don’t need to write a ton. Your chief concern is to convince readers of the strength of your current analytical writing ability - which is at least somewhat predictive of your future law school and legal writing ability.
 
### Be decisive

Consider each option, striving to be fair-minded in weighing the pros and cons, and then clearly argue for ONE option instead of the other. Yes, you’ll easily be able to spot information that could very well support the other option, but you’ll need to stake out a well-defined position early on in your writing and hold it until the end. Now, you’ll notice I said, “HOLD it until the end”, which allows room for some well-considered acknowledgement of what the other option has to offer. A qualified position can be very strong, but of course, don’t forget that your job IS to take a side.

## 5. An example for you to try on your own

This is the writing sample from the [June 2007 LSAT](https://www.lsac.org/sites/default/files/legacy/docs/default-source/jd-docs/sampleptjune.pdf):

"BLZ Stores, an established men’s clothing retailer with a chain of stores in a major metropolitan area, is selecting a plan for expansion. Using the facts below, write an essay in which you argue for one of the following plans over the other based on the following two criteria:

* The company wants to increase its profits.
* The company wants to ensure its long-term financial stability.

The “national plan” is to open a large number of men’s clothing stores throughout the country over a short period of time. In doing this, the company would incur considerable debt. It would also have to greatly increase staff and develop national marketing and distribution capabilities. Many regional companies that adopted this strategy increased their profits dramatically. A greater number tried and failed, suffering severe financial consequences. BLZ is not well known outside its home area. Research indicates that the BLZ name is viewed positively by those who know it. National clothing chains can offer lower prices because of their greater buying power. BLZ currently faces increasingly heavy competition in its home region from such chains.
 
The “regional plan” is to increase the number and size of stores in the company’s home region and upgrade their facilities, product quality, and service. This could be achieved for the most part with existing cash reserves. These upgrades would generally increase the prices that BLZ charges. In one trial store in which such changes were implemented, sales and profits have increased. The local population is growing. BLZ enjoys strong customer loyalty. Regional expansion could be accomplished primarily using BLZ’s experienced and loyal staff and would allow continued reliance on known and trusted suppliers, contractors, and other business connections.”

## Further Learning

Now that you hopefully have a better understanding of what LSAT Writing is and how you can tackle the assignment, feel free to test your skills, giving yourself a bit less than 35 minutes to work on the above prompt (provided you just took some time to read it). You may pick up some important skills applicable to LSAT writing when you're preparing for the [LSAT Logical Reasoning](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/lsat-logical-reasoning/) sections, so study up!
 
For plenty of additional released writing sample prompts, ask your [LSAT tutor](https://www.wyzant.com/LSAT_tutors.aspx) to go over the end of any printed LSAT PrepTest, which will actually include the prompt used as part of that test administration. You can easily get a good amount of practice using some of these (ideally between 2 and 4) over the course of your LSAT prep.
