## Four studies demonstrate how 8 hours of working with a private tutor can have such a dramatic effect on your child’s behavior and grades.

While letter grades are important (especially when we think about the increasingly competitive college application process), they rarely tell the whole story. It’s the tip of the iceberg when it comes to one-on-one learning outcomes.

And the science is behind it. From a personalized experience to the removal of peer pressure, private tutoring provides positive reinforcement. It’s more than just how to improve your grades, it’s how to improve a student’s learning experience.

Don’t believe us? Here’s the research:

## Finding 1: Eight Weeks of Tutoring Reduces Math Anxiety By Up to 20%

Math anxiety has proven to be as real as any other phobia. You might have it! But just like any phobia, it’s “all in your head,” to the point they trigger reactions in the brain. Opening a math book can have the same effect on some as seeing a spider or looking down a cliff for others. Seriously!

But how does that affect your student? Well...

With a higher level of angst, students experience [decreased short-term “working memory”](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150619-do-you-have-maths-anxiety). It’s what we use to focus on a task, like summing and calculating problems. That’s not all. When students with high anxiety experience activity think about an upcoming math test, it activates the part of the brain that receives pain.

It’s the **highly personalized nature** of private tutoring which helps kids to “get beyond the bottleneck in a non-negative, encouraging way,” according to researchers.

### Finding 2: When Children Ask Questions, They Want Answers (not Attention)

emember being afraid to raise your hand in front of the class for fear of feeling dumb? It wasn’t feeling dumb you were afraid of, it was the shame that came with it. Unfortunately, no matter how intelligent or engaged a student is (or wants to be), social surroundings play a role.

As trivial as it might seem, those feelings can derail a student’s effort. More importantly, it can dampen the willingness to take chances. Here’s why that’s important:

* Children need to ask questions: When given the chance to ask questions, a child’s thinking ability can be surprising largely because they are more invested in finding an answer.

* Children need to make mistakes. Without them, children never learn to overcome failure. Fixed mindset versus a growth mindset.

Working one-on-one removes this fear entirely. If not at first, then over the few lessons it takes for a child to learn their private tutor is really a caring, unjudging teacher.

### Finding 3: Giving Student's Choices Increases Their Willingness to Take on Difficult Tasks

While it might seem counterintuitive, giving children choices results in an increased attention span. In 2008, researchers from Duke looked at 41 separate studies and found when children had a choice in what they worked on, they were more likely to take on tasks that were challenging. In addition, a child given the chance to learn something they enjoy has shown to result in a higher level of persistence and a greater dedication to completing the work at hand.

Student’s need variety. Whether it’s where they study, the number of subjects being covered, or the amount of different exercises being worked on, [studies as far back as 1978](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/07/health/views/07mind.html?pagewanted=2&_r=4) show retention improves with flexible circumstances. Equally as important, learning new things [helps children’s brains to change](http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/jugg2.html).

In tutoring, children are forced into a role where they become an active participant in learning. They have the ability to work at their own pace and choose topics and themes that become the vehicle for their learning.

### Finding 4: Students with Involved Parents are More Likely to Earn Higher Test Scores and Enroll in Higher-Level Programs

As a parent, you’ve probably seen it. The more (or less) time you’ve spent helping your child or actively discussing school has had an effect. It’s a [foregone conclusion](http://www.nea.org/tools/17360.htm) when you as a parent are involved, kids stand a greater chance to earn higher grades and even enroll in higher-level programs.

What is it about parental involvement that does that? The easy answer is parents help children succeed on work itself. A less obvious outcome is the way it encourages positive school behaviors. Your child notices and learns from everything you do, including exhibiting values like organizing and being helpful. Those values are powerful and important parts of school success.

But what about when you have multiple kids, or lose the time to take as big a role as you’d like (it happens!)? A private tutor serves as an extension of you, while enforcing those same positive values. And through your own interaction with the tutor, you can still play a significant part, and your child won’t have to struggle without the necessary support.

The classrooms of today are as foreign to parents as any time before, but what a child needs to learn is the same as ever. When you take the time to understand how they learn, it makes the journey towards success (and the bumps along the way) all the more meaningful.
