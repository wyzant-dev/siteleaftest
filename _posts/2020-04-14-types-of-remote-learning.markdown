With the global COVID-19 pandemic requiring educational institutions to remain closed, many schools are taking to remote learning while some parents have to homeschool their kids. For those completely new to the landscape, it may be difficult to understand what remote learning really entails. 

What kind of [at-home learning](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/learning-at-home/) options do students have? Do different phrases mean the same thing? What’s the difference between distance learning and digital education? Isn’t online learning just the same as e-learning? Most importantly, which is the best option for your kid?

You may have a lot of [questions](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/questions-to-ask-tutors/), so check out the different types of remote learning to understand the landscape better:

## 1: Online Learning
Online learning or digital learning involves the use of online tools for learning, with the key element being the use of the internet to receive and exchange information. It typically involves an interaction between teachers and students through online classes and platforms. So, schools resorting to virtual classes to keep the education going are a form of online learning.
There can be different forms of online learning, which is where all the confusion tends to occur. It’s crucial to note that online learning is a method of receiving education remotely, which makes it a form of remote learning. Yet it can also have several sub-types. 

For instance, you can have entire online courses for college-level education from a formal educational institution. You can have professionals signing up for online courses to learn a particular skill to help with their work or employment prospect.

School students can also get [online tutoring](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/online-tutoring-best-practices/) on the specific subjects they have difficulty with on top of the classes conducted by the school. That is, they work with an online tutor independently from the formal classes they have at school. These are all part of the online learning and digital education landscape.

## 2: Distance Learning
While often considered synonymous with online learning, distance learning varies slightly. Distance learning is typically part of a formal education institution, whereas online learning can involve non-formal educational institutions as well. Non-formal educational institutions may include (but aren’t limited to) online tutoring platforms and professional skill-development courses. 

The similarity is that you still rely on online tools such as discussion boards, video calls, and learning management systems of the institution. So, distance learning is a form of online learning but the two are not synonymous. 

In other words, independent online tutoring and professional online courses won’t be a part of distance learning. However, schools providing online education through virtual classes and colleges offering online courses are a part of distance learning.

## 3: E-Learning
Again, e-learning is often used interchangeably with online learning but there’s a slight difference between the two. E-learning refers to the online interaction that occurs between a teacher and a student. Under this method, students can learn their lessons through an online medium even when the teacher is in the same building as them, which helps to simulate work-based learning situations.

So the main difference is that online learning solely focuses on remote learning through online methods, while e-learning can be used in both a physical classroom and an online setting. For example, students may be present in a physical classroom but the teacher may use an online training module to teach a particular lesson.

## 4: Blended Learning
As the name suggests, blended learning is a combination of traditional learning in a physical classroom and digital learning through online tools and platforms. Students will have a fixed schedule for attending part of the classes on campus, while completing the rest of the course through virtual learning methods. This means they’ll do their assignments and coursework online and attend some classes virtually.

More often than not, they’ll also have a fixed schedule to receive live online lessons from a remote teacher using a virtual conferencing platform. Some educational institutions may also provide an option for students to customize their virtual learning timetable at their convenience. This can be extremely beneficial for students who wish to pursue a college course while juggling other things like work and professional training courses.

## 5: Remote Learning
Remote learning is an umbrella term for all the learning that takes place remotely outside of a traditional classroom setting. It involves a form of learning where the instructor or the source of information and the learner are separated by time and/or distance. There’s minimal to no physical presence involved, and the information typically gets transmitted through online tools and platforms.

In remote learning, students will mostly access educational resources online, receive their lessons online, take their tests online, and submit their assignments online. At the same time, they may also receive traditional educational resources like textbooks depending on the institution. Some remote learning students may also need to submit their assignments and coursework physically, even though their lessons and classes all take place online.

So, online learning and distance learning are all forms of remote learning. Yet the landscape encompasses many other learning methods besides the two. It also includes virtual exchange programs that take place internationally, but more on this later.

## 6: Homeschooling
Homeschooling is the process of educating children at home rather than sending them to a traditional school. In most homeschooling situations, parents will be the ones doing the teaching. However, some parents may instead hire private tutors to provide quality at-home education in spite of their busy schedule. These private homeschool tutors can either conduct lessons through in-home visits or through digital platforms.

The biggest difference with online learning is that homeschooling doesn’t solely focus on using online educational resources. Typically, parents and in-home private tutors will use traditional textbooks and offline learning methods as well as conduct tests through traditional methods. 

Yet some parents may also leave an online private tutor in charge of their kids’ homeschooling. In other words, homeschooling can either involve digital learning or offline learning, or it could blend the two depending on the family’s preferences. Additionally, it’s important to note that working with an online homeschool tutor is the only homeschooling method that’s a part of remote learning.

Now with most schools remaining closed due to coronavirus, more and more parents have to resort to homeschooling even though they have no clue [how to homeschool their kids](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/how-to-homeschool/). It can be challenging to navigate the landscape, especially if you’re new to it. Where do you start and how do you even make sure that your kids are benefiting from their lessons?

To top it all off, citywide lockdowns may prevent private tutors from paying an in-home visit to tutor your child. So the best option is to work with an [online homeschool tutor](https://www.wyzant.com/Homeschool_tutors.aspx) to provide your kid with personalized one-on-one learning in spite of school closures. That way, you can still make sure that they keep up with their classes while ensuring their safety. 

Considering the low [cost of online tutoring](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/cost-of-tutoring/), it’s a particularly attractive option for parents struggling to homeschool their kids amid the crisis brought on by coronavirus. However, it also works even for students whose school is still providing digital education through online classes. It will help them keep up with their lessons and get extra work done on the subjects they struggle with. 

While online tutoring is most popular among middle school and high school students, you can find tutors to provide private lessons at every level. In fact, you can even find [tutors for elementary school students](https://www.wyzant.com/Elementary_Education_tutors.aspx).  

## 7: Virtual Exchange
Virtual exchange is a method of remote learning combined with student exchange programs. It involves the use of technology for connecting students and educational institutions in different parts of the world. Most virtual exchange programs are international and typically focus on college-level education. They allow participants in different countries to enhance their knowledge and skills as well as gain global competencies. 

Since the learning takes place through online platforms, virtual exchange programs are a method of online learning and distance learning. It is also a form of remote learning, as there’s a physical and time distance between the student and their instructor or facilitator.

## What’s best for your kid right now?
Now the obvious question you might have is which of these options is best for your kid at the moment. This is a pressing concern, especially with the school closures brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Parents who are already homeschooling their kids will have no trouble adapting to the changes because they’re already used to teaching their kids at home. That’s not to say that they won’t need help with an online homeschooling tutor if they feel too overwhelmed or slightly debilitated due to the ongoing crisis. 
For parents who were sending their kids to a traditional school, however, the answer will be a little bit more subjective. It largely depends on how the school is handling the issue and how well your child is adapting to the at-home learning situation as well as your current work situation.

First of all, is the school still continuing with the session through online classes? If so, you might not have to worry too much about homeschooling, though you should still consider an online private tutor if your kid is having trouble adapting to their new learning environment. 

If the school isn’t holding online classes, you’ll have to consider homeschooling your kid. This is the most daunting scenario, especially if you have to juggle it with working from home. The good news is that you always have the option to get [experienced homeschool tutors](https://www.wyzant.com/Homeschool_tutors.aspx) to take over and ensure that your kids don’t fall behind with their lessons.
