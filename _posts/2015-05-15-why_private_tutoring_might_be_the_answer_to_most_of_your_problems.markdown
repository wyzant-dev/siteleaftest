## If you’ve ever had your evening derailed by a badly phrased fourth-grade math question, you know that educating a student is as much of a challenge as keeping them safe.

If you’re having headaches piled upon exhaustion night after night as a result of your child’s homework or upcoming exams, you may need to reconsider a few things.

The main thing to think about is that not everything HAS to be on your plate. Here are four ways a private tutor can solve some real-life issues faced by most parents.

### You Can Break Through Barriers

It’s easy to think that what you went through in school is what your child is going through. That’s why for many, tutoring is an eye-opening experience. So often, students remain deaf to the counsel of their parents and the advice of their teachers for fear of being criticized. With a tutor, they have the option to listen to someone new who is engaging with them in a way that speaks to them.

The tutoring environment allows students to open up, giving their tutors (and themselves) an honest look at their habits without the danger of ridicule.

Even more, with greater self-esteem, your child could become more active and less self-conscious in class. This gives the teacher the opportunity to bring to light their observations on the skills and weaknesses of your child.

### You Will Never Fail at Homework Again

You’ve lived the viral posts about Common Core, and have experienced first-hand how it can bring a rocket scientist to his knees. You know that as much as you want to help, sometimes you just...can’t. Not only does giving up in frustration make you feel dumb, it’s an alienating experience for you and your child. But fighting any longer would just make it worse for both of you.

A private tutor helps to end those frustrations in two ways:

* **It removes you from the situation.**
* **It gives you someone you can ask, and a way to learn those skills yourself.**

### You Can Build a Better Relationship With Teachers

As an informed third party, private tutors help parents benefit from an enhanced parent-teacher relationship. Almost instantly, two different sets of opinions and observations (one from at home, one from in school) can be evaluated, translated, and mediated. A tutor’s independence from the pressures of the classroom, and the needs of 29 other students, means they zero in on the emotions and needs of your child.

In fact, having the tutor communicate directly with the teacher has its own distinct benefits. It paves a two-way street where the tutor can better strengthen the student’s performance in class and the teacher has a much better understanding of strengths and weaknesses.

### You Can Say Goodbye to Guilt (Or at Least Some of It)

If your evenings are catch-as-you-can dinners where kids are under the gun to finish their homework while you help one after the other until bedtime, then there is no relaxed time that you’re spending with your family.

With a private tutor, not only can children complete their assignments, but they can complete them faster with a tutor speaking in a language that you’ve had trouble deciphering. That means the home you come back to is family friendly (and less likely to exhaust you).

The bottom line is it’s hard to be a parent. It’s one thing after the next, but recruiting someone to help is a good first step.
