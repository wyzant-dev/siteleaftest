## Screen time is a hot topic among parents these days. While the stats are conflicting about how kids should be using screens (tablets, tv’s, mobile devices) and when they should start using them, a few things have become clear.

The first is that the number of children using screens is trending upward (see below). The second is that not all screen time is necessarily negative. Perhaps most important is the fact that when faced with the above two facts, every parent reacts differently.

Should you choose to monitor your child’s media diet with an iron fist or a loving look over the shoulder, here are some key trends to be aware of and how the new rise in online tutoring can play an important role.

## **What the Stats Say**

According to the [American Academy of Pediatrics](https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/pages/media-and-children.aspx), children today spend an average of seven hours on entertainment media each day. It might sound like a lot, but when you consider it includes televisions, computers, phones and other electronic devices, there are less likely statements.

And the numbers are growing. From 2011 to 2013, the number of kids who’ve used mobile devices nearly doubled. Likewise, children use screens more as they get older (an entire hour more by the time they get to age 10).

But all things considered, that’s not necessarily bad.

Studies have shown that children who use educational media on their screens learn more in the short term, and also do better in school later on. Replacing mindless video game time, or even healthier documentary time, with some quality face-to-face time can pay heavy dividends.

Screen time is, ultimately, **essential** for students to succeed. Kids who are computer literate and tech savvy will be in a better position to succeed. As parents and educators, an important part of the job is to help students use screens as an enhancement to their learning, while steering them away from the “empty calories.”

So the question is, how can you get your child more interested in educational material?

## **Where the Opportunity Lies**

### 1. Replacing “Bad” Screen Time with “Healthy” Screen Time

Putting a qualified teacher or tutor on the other end of the screen pays dividends in both the long-term and short-term.

In the short-term, there is the cultivation of increased enthusiasm over traditional educational content—like apps or offline games—which can't match the dynamic of working with real person. Tutors can read the emotions and body language of students and respond in a way that games don't.

Parents also feel greater assurance that their efforts are having a positive effect. It’s much easier to see the connection between a student and tutor than a student and a game. Likewise, where a game will run out of challenges or levels, a resourceful tutor never will.

In the long run, a tutor can help raise your child’s interest in educational media. A good tutor aids parents in finding new and engaging educational content. They also pique a child’s interest, causing a jolt of enthusiasm during tutoring time which can effectively lead them to choose a healthier media diet outside of tutoring.

### 2. A Perfect Mix Between Screen Time and Interaction Time

A well-documented concern about screen use is the fact it too often serves as a replacement for personal interaction. This can be detrimental for children, whose skills need constant maintenance. According to a study done at [UCLA on a group of sixth-graders](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2014/08/28/343735856/kids-and-screen-time-what-does-the-research-say), replacing interaction with screen time can improve a child’s ability to recognize emotion in facial expressions.

That need for interaction makes online private tutoring the best of both worlds (or at least a solid medium): Students can get social interaction where they are most comfortable—through technology.

While you might feel like tricking them is the best way to get them to the intersection of screen use and education, that doesn’t have to be the case. By enlisting the guidance and assistance of another adult who has an informed opinion, you can put students on the path to guiding themselves.
