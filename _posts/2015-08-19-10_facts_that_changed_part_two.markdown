## This is the second in our two-part series on facts your student will learn that are different than what you were taught. If you missed part one, you can find it [here](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/10_facts_that_changed_part_one).

### Fact 6: Earth is not the only planet in the solar system with water.

We were told in school that only Earth had water, the main component we know of for sustaining life. But new research is showing water on Jupiter’s moon, Europa, so even if the proverbial cup isn’t running over, we can be sure water is not as uncommon in our solar system as we once thought.

In 2008, NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander found ice on Mars, and in 2009 ice was found on Earth’s moon from the crash landing of Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite—though whether that ice was ever in water form is still an unknown. NASA’s footage from the New Horizon spacecraft, which gave us the first photos of Pluto in July 2015, has caused speculation that Pluto also has ice.

Extra credit: Though we might have heard that Mars is dusty, cold, and no place to raise a kid, Elon Musk is still moving forward his plans for colonizing it. His company SpaceX is dedicated to helping people migrate to other planets. First stop: Mars.

### Fact 7: Your map is all wrong, but we don’t really have a perfect one.

Mercator maps, commonly used in classrooms, show Greenland as being the same size as Africa, Great Britain being the same size as Madagascar, and Russia being several times the size of the US. None of that is true. As the Earth is round and maps are two-dimensional, the proportions get distorted. Africa is about 14 times larger than Greenland. But what the Mercator maps do well is make the distance between two points clear and are therefore useful for navigation.

Extra credit: When it comes to borders, it’s not as easy as drawing a line. According to the [CIA Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2070.html), there are over 100 disputed borders and territories as you read this article.

### Fact 8: Accused witches in Salem were not burned at the stake.

Mostly, accused witches in Salem in the late 1690s were hanged for their “crimes”. The burning of witches, though common in Europe, was not practiced in Salem. Giles Corey, who refused to enter a plea, was pressed to death—and some of the accused died in prison while awaiting trial or sentencing.

Extra credit: Arthur Miller’s play “The Crucible” was a fictionalized account of the Salem witch trials, but also a commentary on McCarthyism and the communist witch hunts of the 1950s. In 1956 Miller was subpoenaed by the House of Un-American Activities (Marilyn Monroe accompanied Miller to his hearing). He was forthcoming with his own activities, but Miller refused to name names and as a result was charged with contempt of Congress. The charge was overturned a year later.

### Fact 9: Athens wasn’t the first democracy; they just picked a good name for it.

Though many of us learned the city-state of Athens was the birthplace of democracy, several Indian and Mesopotamian cultures had the concept of rule by the people before the Greeks. However, the people in this case were usually just a group of men. The Greeks, however, did coin the term “democracy”, which we still use today, leading them to be given the position of having started the whole idea.

Extra credit: For the people means all the people right? In 1906, when Finland abolished both race and gender requirements for serving in government positions and voting, they became the first country to do so.

### Fact 10: On second thought, don’t follow that first food pyramid we showed you.

Whether or not you believe the dairy industry lobbied for its own section, the fact remains the way we’re taught about what’s healthy and what we should eat has changed over time. In 2011, the USDA, after an unsuccessful revamp of the Food Pyramid into MyPyramid, unveiled My Plate. Instead of the rather detailed USDA Food Pyramid of your childhood, kids today get one straightforward plate showing 40% vegetables, 30% grains, 20% protein and 10% fruit. There’s also a little circle of dairy right outside the plate, in case you believe in a good dairy-based conspiracy. And, the new 40% vegetable plate is a lot higher than the 3-5 servings on the original food pyramid, but shhh, we don’t have to tell the kids about that one.

Ultimate, facts change as we learn more about our own history, find better ways to analyze data, and explore the universe. And while your kids probably have no idea what a card catalogue is, they'll undoubtedly out-text you one day or explain a simple technology trick that's had you stumped for weeks. It’s okay; it’s all part of the job.
