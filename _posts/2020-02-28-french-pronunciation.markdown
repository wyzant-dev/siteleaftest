Pronunciation is a crucial piece of [how to learn French](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/start-learning-french/). Many English speakers find it the most frustrating part, even more than learning [grammar fundamentals](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/french-grammar-basics/). That does not mean it is impossible, though. The [sounds may be harder](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/is-french-hard-to-learn/) to make with your mouth, but the rules are much more consistent than those for English. So, once you get how each syllable sounds in French, instead of associating it with the English alphabet, the words are pretty much pronounced how they are spelled.

If you have read our [French for travel](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/basic-french-words-phrases/?fbclid=IwAR2VxOj03S0DFT5S4ejQDTo1S4uD5e4GXWEISIsHSKD53dzuASgqOnm-sFY) crash course, you might recognize some of these tips. This guide will dive deeper. It will cover not only how to pronounce French letters and syllables that differ from English, but other French pronunciation rules like syllable stress, accent marks and *le liason*.

Of course, there is only so much you can learn about pronunciation through reading alone. The best things you can do to practice pronunciation are listening to native speakers and speaking out loud until you can emulate them. Some great ways to listen include [news](https://www.france24.com/fr/direct), [podcasts](https://www.fluentu.com/blog/french/french-podcasts/), movies, and TV series. Getting a [tutor or conversation partner](https://www.wyzant.com/French_tutors.aspx) is also a good idea. 

## How do you know which syllables to stress?

Before getting into the weeds of phonetics, let’s start with something pretty easy: syllable stress. If you listen to a native French speaker, you will notice that they speak with a fairly even tone. But what you may not notice with an untrained ear is that they always put a slight emphasis on the last syllable. 

Let’s look at some cognates as examples, since they take away all the other variables.

|          Word         |   English Stress  |   French Stress   |
|:---------------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
| Revolution/Révolution | rev-o-LU-tion     | rev-o-lu-TION     |
| Important             | im-POR-tant       | im-por-TANT       |
| Communication         | com-mun-i-CA-tion | com-mun-i-ca-TION |

## Accent marks

French accent marks can easily trip up English speakers, as we are not accustomed to them. But they are not scary once you get used to them. Here are all of the accent marks, their French names, and explanations of what they do. 

### É - Accent aigu

The *accent aigu* only appears above the letter E. Pronounced like ay. 

Examples of words that include it: *desolé, médicin*

### È - Accent grave

The *accent grave* usually appears above the letter E, but can appear above any vowel. Pronounced like the E in the English word get.

Examples of words that include it: *problème, deuxième*

### Ç - Accent cedille

The *cedille* appears under the letter C. Makes the sound soft, like an S as opposed to hard like a K. 

Examples of words that include in: *français, garçon*

### Ö - Accent trema

The *trema* can appear over any vowel. Makes the second vowel in a pair voiced. It is often used with names and places. 

Examples of words that include it: *coïncidence, Zoë*

### Ô - Circonflexe

The *circonflexe* can appear over any vowel. It does not significantly alter the pronunciation. There is a [movement](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35496893) to remove it from the language, but it is still important to recognize it and know which words include it. 

Examples of words that include it: *être, hôtel*

## Vowels and semivowels

You probably know what a vowel is, but you might not know what a semi-vowel is. Semi-vowels are sliding sounds like “wah,” “wee,” and “way” that exist in the little space between consonants and vowels. This table will not only tell you how these letters are pronounced in French, but help you tell the difference between the same vowels with and without accent marks.

The table, and all others in the guide moving forward, will spell out pronunciations in both the [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/) (IPA) and English approximations. Getting familiar with the IPA is a good idea for any language learner, as English approximations are just that: approximations. Our pronunciation rules are inconsistent and some sounds from other languages do not exist in English. 

|        Letter       	| IPA symbol      	| English Approx.      	|  Example words 	|
|:-------------------:	|:---------------:	|:--------------------:	|:--------------:	|

|          ou         	|        u        	|         food         	|  Roue (wheel)  	|
|        ai,ei        	|        ɛ        	|         best         	|   Fait (made)  	|

## Consonants 

Most consonants are pronounced the same way in English and in French, so this table will focus on the ones that are not. 

|         Letter        	| IPA symbol      	| English Approx.      	|       Example words      	|
|:---------------------:	|:---------------:	|:--------------------:	|:------------------------:	|
|  c (after e or i), ç  	|        s        	|        center        	|        Ceci (this)       	|
|   c (anywhere else)   	|        k        	|         kiss         	|       Car (because)      	|
|           ch          	|        ʃ        	|         shoe         	|     Chère (expensive)    	|
|  g (before e or i), j 	|        ʒ        	|        measure       	|     Général (general)    	|
|   g (anywhere else)   	|        ɡ        	|          go          	| Gare (train/bus station) 	|
|          qu,q         	|        k        	|         kiss         	|         Qui (who)        	|
|           r           	|        ʁ        	|      Guttural R      	|      Regarde (look)      	|
| s (beginning of word) 	|        s        	|          sir         	|      Sans (without)      	|
|   s (middle of word)  	|        z        	|         rose         	|       Chose (thing)      	|
|           th          	|        t        	|         style        	|         Thé (tea)        	|

### A few notes about specific consonants

*La cedille* makes the rule of soft c’s apply to c’s that precede other letters.

To master the guttural R, pretend you are gargling water from the back of your throat.

The “th” sound English speakers know from words like “thick” does not exist in French.

## Nasal sounds

Nasal sounds are a distinctive feature of French. The dialect spoken in Quebec is particularly nasal. English has nasal sounds, but they are all consonants: m, n, and ng. In French, the nasal sounds are vowel-consonant combinations. 

When you say them, redirect air that would normally come out of your nose. To see what that feels like, say “sing”, “sang”, “song”, and “sung” out loud in English, and notice how your tongue presses against your soft palate. 

|         Sound         	| IPA symbol      	| English Approx.      	|   Example words  	|
|:---------------------:	|:---------------:	|:--------------------:	|:----------------:	|
|         om, on        	|      ɔ̃m/ɔ̃n      	|     “on” in song     	|    Nom (name)    	|
|         um, un        	|      œ̃m/œ̃n      	|     “un” in sung     	| Parfum (perfume) 	|
| im, in, aim, ain, ein 	|      Ɛ̃m, Ɛ̃n     	|     “an” in sang     	|    Vin (wine)    	|
|     am, an, em, en    	|      ɑ̃m, ɑ̃n     	|         “ahn”        	|   Champ (field)  	|
|          ien          	|        jn       	|        "ee-an"       	| Bien (well)      	|

To understand the way they work, it is especially important to listen to native speakers and imitate them.

## Silent letters

The [evolution of the French language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_history_of_French) is a wild ride that a lot of consonant sounds did not make it to the end of. The details of it are kind of difficult to understand if you are not a linguistic historian. These include H at the beginning of words and D, G, M, N, P, S, X , and Z at the end of words. There are some exceptions for names and words that originated in other languages. 

In certain cases, e’s in the middle of words are skipped over. This is called the *e muet* or an unvoiced e. It applies to words like *acheter* and *appeler*. It is also how all “-er” verbs conjugated in the [*futur simple*](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/french-future-tense/) are pronounced. 

## Notable syllables 

These are some combinations of letters that are not intuitive to English speakers. Some of them are instances when a letter that is usually pronounced is silent. Others are diphthongs that are uncommon or non-existent in English. For the non-linguists, a diphthong is when two vowel sounds make up one syllable like the "ou" in loud. 

|           Syllable           	| IPA symbol      	| English Approx.      	|                            Example words                            	|
|:----------------------------:	|:---------------:	|:--------------------:	|:-------------------------------------------------------------------:	|
| er (end of 2+ syllable word) 	|        e        	|          may         	|        Parler (to speak) or the infinitive of any “-er” verb        	|
|       ez (end of word)       	|        e        	|          may         	| Parlez or any other “-er” verb with the present tense “vous” ending 	|
|       ail (end of word)      	|        ɑi       	|        “ah-ee”       	|                            Travail (work)                           	|
|          eil, eille          	|        ɛi       	|        “ay-ee”       	|                             Soleil (sun)                            	|
|              ill             	|        ij       	|        “ee-y”        	|                           Billet (ticket)                           	|
|              gn              	|        ɲ        	|        canyon        	|                           Gagner (to win)                           	|

## What’s *le liason*?

No, not the dangerous kind! *Le liason* is when speakers pronounce a consonant that is usually silent because the following word starts with a vowel or silent h. When you say it, you slide the words together. In the IPA, this slide is expressed like this ‿. 

Here are some examples: 

|    Written   	|     IPA     	| English Approx.      	|
|:------------:	|:-----------:	|:--------------------:	|
|  Nous avons  	|   nuz‿ɑvɔn  	|      noo-zav-ON      	|
|  Vous allez  	|   vuz‿ɑle   	|      voo-za-LAY      	|
| Petit enfant 	| p’tİt‿ɑnfɑn 	|     p’tee-ton-FON    	|
|  Les hotels  	|   lez‿ɔtɛl  	|      lay-zoh-TEL     	|
