You’re considering hiring a tutor because you or your child need some help with one or more academic subjects. The purpose of a tutor is to give private, personalized instruction to accelerate learning, increase retention, and improve academic performance. But there’s more to it than that. Anyone who participated in sports had that one coach who taught them valuable life lessons. The right tutor can have the same kind of impact. Here are seven benefits of hiring a tutor.

## 1. Personalized Accountability

Some people are self-starters. They get things done on time with no motivation but their sense of accomplishment. Those people are rare. For the rest of us, somebody to hold us accountablecan be valuable. With children, a tutor provides a personalized deadline for completing homework and research for in-person check-in. Teachers set deadlines but don’t have the time to make them personally relevant. As a parent, you’re often navigating deep waters in your relationship with your child. A tutor has one job besides instructing: providing accountability support.For an adult, it comes down to the money. If your tutor gives you an assignment, you get less from your investment if you skip the task.

## 2. Identifying Appropriate Goals

Regular classwork led by a teacher sets goals to conform to the mean. The tasks are items the average student can accomplish, given the tools and timeline. It’s necessary, given the realities of a teacher’s classroom, but it’s only appropriate for a handful of students in the center of the curve.

If a student is below the curve, a tutor can give additional instruction and support to help them keep up with the class’s pace. If a student is ahead of the curve, the tutor can find bonus material and new goals. This kind of find-tuned approach is best with one-on-one instruction.

This will help children unlock their potential during the school year, both in general and specific terms. It will generally help keep their GPA up. It can also help identify interests and talents, so you can plan the rest of their education to best set them up for success.For an adult, a tutor can help you plan your continuing education with your life details. They will 
look at your work, family, and recreational commitments and set reasonable timelines and goals.

## 3. Bridging the Support Gap

A tutor can help gifted students further explore their interests and develop their skills.For children, it provides an intelligent, interested study partner to guide them through advanced materials both from class and for self-study. It can provide instruction on topics that aren’t available to the child.Adults are no longer part of the school system, and highly intelligent adults can benefit from tutors. This relationship can broaden their horizons and help them dive even deeper into their area of specialization.

## 4. Enhanced Performance

In his landmark book “Outliers,” Malcolm Gladwell proved that children identified early as talented and gifted receive special treatment. That special treatment enhances performance, which supports the identification that the child is unique, creating a self-reinforcing upward spiral of achievement. “Outliers” proved this occurs in academics, sports, and professional fields. A tutor for your child can position them as talented and gifted, and they may receive special treatment accordingly, further spurring their growth.Adults can benefit from this at work using the same concept. Whether taking on a new job, a new responsibility, or a new topic, getting the tutoring necessary can propel your career.

## 5. It Shows Investment

The opposite of the above is also exact. If a child at school, or an adult at work, is identified as slacking off or untalented, it makes success a challenge for them. Their achievements are ignored or written off as flukes, while every failure is evidence the original assessment was correct. For children, having a tutor fights this predicament in three ways. First, it makes up for the lack of committed instruction in the classroom through personal help. Second, it improves the quality of work. Finally, once a teacher realizes the student has a tutor, they will understand the student is invested in success and may treat them differently.Adults get all the same benefits, but your supervisor won’t know you have a tutor unless you 
mention it in passing. It’s worth doing so; your willingness to spend your own time and money to improve performance will be noticed.

## 6. Structure and Schedule

You’re more likely to go to the gym if you have an appointment with a personal trainer than if you only go by yourself. Similarly, when a student has a general syllabus on a term-long schedule, it becomes easy to put off work in favor of other things — which is even more true of adults with adult responsibilities. A tutor provides a weekly (or more frequent) check-in.

Subdividing long-term projects into short-term goals is a tried and true tactic for managing time and resources. The natural structure of frequent, personal meetings with a tutor helps you do precisely that. For kids, this is mostly a matter of checking in on progress. As a parent, you have a lot to worry about without focusing on the minutiae of a study schedule. The tutor can look at the class syllabus, set a program, and plan sessions accordingly.

Adults will find this benefit especially useful because of the demands of adult life. The tutor can help you set a work, study, family, and play schedule based on your life’s specific and individual needs. Each week, they can hold you accountable to that schedule and help you make adjustments based on how things shift and change.

## 7. An Interested Observer

A tutor provides an extra set of eyes, noticing changes in practice and other warning signs abouta child. A tutor might see something other adults haven’t noticed. It’s a good idea to schedule a monthly or quarterly session with your child’s tutor so you can check in on what the tutor has observed. As an adult, a tutor can help you see things about your study habits, goals, priorities, and careerthat you lack the outside perspective to notice. This can help you not just with the specific topic in which you’re being tutored, but in success with life in general.

## Final ThoughtS

These side benefits of hiring a tutor are powerful. They’re so powerful that some families don’t wait until a student falls behind before hiring one. Instead, they find an excellent tutor to work with the student on whatever topics they want the most help with, have the most trouble with, or even want to push from good performance to excellent progress. A quality tutor, as we said, is like a good coach. The things they teach about the subject you hire them for can be among the least essential lessons they impart.
