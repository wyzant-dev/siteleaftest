The Snapshot Series is a collection of 30-minute tutor talks, followed by an open Q&A. Anyone can listen, join the conversation and learn. And it’s absolutely free for every attendee.

Perfect for beginners, this talk will lay out the basics of Java:

* where to begin

* the basics of programs

* and why it all matters—so you can decide if Java is the language to get you started in coding
