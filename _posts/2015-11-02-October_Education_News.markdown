## Here it is! The best and most interesting content of the last month, all in one quick place.

From interesting surveys to ground-breaking studies, there are volumes to digest, ponder, and second-guess. The world of education is constantly evolving, but when days are a blur and schedules are packed, who has the time to keep up?

We do. Let us keep you up to date because we know that time, like education, is invaluable…

### [American Kids Have Disappointing Reading and Math Scores, But There Are Some Bright Spots](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/naep-scores_562fd4fde4b06317990fcf74?utm_hp_ref=education)

The National Assessment of Education Progress (aka the Nation’s Report Card) was released on Wednesday, October 28. It’s a national test given to fourth and eighth graders, and it’s been called the “gold standard” of student assessments.

On the surface, the headlines show that between 2013 (the last time the test was administered) and 2015, scores decreased. Though many say there are a lot of reasons to not make snap judgements. Including the fact these scores have been trending upwards since 1990.

### [Experiment Tests if Teacher-Student Relationship Helps Performance](http://www.npr.org/2015/10/13/448182553/experiment-tests-if-teacher-student-relationship-helps-performance)
**In *NPR***

The short answer? It does.

Recently, German researchers have been digging into just how powerful that relationship can be. Their study, which focused on kindergarteners solving pattern recognition problems, found that kids solved problems faster when reminded of teachers they like. Talk about the human factor!

### [Poll: Americans Give High Marks to Community Colleges for Quality, Value](http://hechingerreport.org/poll-americans-give-high-marks-to-community-colleges-for-quality-value/)
**By Jon Marcus in *The Herchinger Report***

Community colleges are no longer a last resort for students. At least that’s what students say.

WGBH News in Boston found that when asked to rank the value received from community colleges, public universities, and private universities, Americans chose community college. Public Universities came in second, while less than half of responders saw the private university experience as a good value.

### [You Can’t Work Your Way Through College Anymore](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-28/you-can-t-work-your-way-through-college-anymore)

With the cost of college tuition soaring 46 percent between 2001 and 2012, a study out of Georgetown all but declared “working your way through college” is a thing of the past.

While the part about paying off tens of thousands of dollars in tuition with a part (or full) time job seems obvious, the study also looked at the relationship between jobs and collegiate studies. The results explored the optimal workload for academic performance (15-20 hours) and that paid internships significantly lifted graduate’s job prospects.

### [Children Want Factual Stories, Versus Fantasy, More Often than Adults](http://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2015/10/19/449865847/children-want-factual-stories-versus-fantasy-more-often-than-adults)
**By Tania Lombrozo in *NPR***

“Which would you choose: A story about a boy who lives on an invisible farm? Or a story about a boy with lots of brothers and sisters?”

That’s what psychologists asked a group of 4-7 year olds and a group of adults as part of a study earlier this year. They wanted to know adults and children’s preferences for fact versus fiction stories. To their surprise, children were more likely to prefer stories that had an element of realism than adults. They speculated children’s interest based on the fact that “real” stories are still novel to them.

### BONUS: [For Students, the Importance of Doing Work That Matters](http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2014/04/30/what-if-we-assigned-students-work-that-matters-outside-of-school/)
**By Will Richardson in *Mindshift KQED***

(Not so new, still so good…)

Students at a high school in Philadelphia are designing solar panels for hospitals in the African bush. Primary schoolers are designing a new classroom wing being built at their school in Australia. Technology has done more than make assessing students easier. Why not make a difference through their education?

Findings and theories about what education are changing at the speed of the internet. As a parent, this knowledge is a way to understand what our students are capable of. It’s powerful.

And we’ll bring it all right to your fingertips.
