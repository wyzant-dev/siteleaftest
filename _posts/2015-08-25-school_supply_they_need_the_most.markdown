There is always a mix of excitement and apprehension during the back to school season.
Whether your child will be driving themselves to school for the first time or getting settled into their college dorms, the question, "is my child ready for what’s next?" is likely hovering in the background.

As a parent, you can help them prepare to make this year a successful one. Here’s a list of back-to-school essentials that every high school or college student needs this fall:

* Computer and/or iPad

* Notebooks (when computers aren’t allowed in class)

* Writing supplies: pens, pencils, and highlighters

* Flashcards

* Scientific calculator (TI-83 or TI-84)

* An expert tutor

An expert private tutor will help your student understand complicated concepts, give them more confidence to ace exams, and achieve the scores they need on standardized tests. With an expert tutor, you give your student the advantage on whatever comes up, whether it's:

### Daily Homework Help and Long-term Mastery of Concepts

It’s natural for students of every age to want a quick solution to the problem in front of them, but understanding and mastering the entire concept is essential for long-term success. Working with a tutor will help your student get short-term wins, as well as develop their skills, understanding, and study habits.

### Expert Preparation for Every Midterm and Final

A private tutor is THE best study tool when it comes to preparing for midterms and finals—especially when they’ve been working with your student all semester and know exactly what (and how) your student is learning and where they need help.

If your student has last-minute test questions or needs to squeeze in a lesson that fits into their busy schedule, try [online tutoring](https://www.wyzant.com/tutorsearch/online). Wyzant's online lessons mean you can access your tutor whenever you need help.

### Affordable, One-on-one Attention for Standardized Tests

Is your child taking the SAT or MCAT? If you’ve looked up test prep courses, then you are already familiar with the large textbooks, hundreds of practice tests, and an expensive bill. Most test prep courses are also taught in a group setting by an instructor you don’t get to choose.

For these rigorous tests, the best way for your child to reach their goals is one-on-one with an expert. [Studies ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_Sigma_Problem)show that 98% of students who work with a private tutor outperform their peers. The private tutors listed on Wyzant are affordable and can give your child the individual attention they need to improve their score.

With a private tutor, you’ll make sure your student starts the year off right!
