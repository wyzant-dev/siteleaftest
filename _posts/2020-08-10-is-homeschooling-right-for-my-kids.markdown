On July 30th, 2020, Wyzant hosted a free live Q&A with professional homeschooling educators. Hosted by President Elaine Richards, our panel answered questions from the Wyzant community about a topic on the minds of many families in the US as the pandemic puts back-to-school plans in flux: how can you be sure [homeschooling](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/which-homeschool-approach-is-right-for-your-kids/) is right for your kids? 

According to a recent Real Clear Opinion Poll, 40% of the 2,122 families surveyed said they plan to homeschool their children in the fall of 2020. That trend continues to grow, and since there are so many [misconceptions about homeschooling](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/myths-about-homeschooling/), parents understandably are looking for support. 

For kids who are learning at home (and parents who’ve become educators), a [tutor provides a coach](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/tutoring-homeschool-help/), a personalized learning plan, and most importantly, structure and accountability. For those families who are going the homeschool route, a tutor can help objectively enhance your kid’s education, and provide structure for your family’s goals and capabilities. 

Look no further than a personal “homeschool coach” to ensure that you set reasonable timelines and manage time effectively - which takes a lot of skill and hard work, for even seasoned homeschoolers.

We hope this chance to watch our in-depth talk with experienced educators on Wyzant results in some useful and actionable advice for your family.
