## Intellectual Independence

The backbone of the tutor-tutee dynamic is that it gives students the tools they need to be successful in their education. Tutoring helps a student develop the cognitive skills that enable them to identify problems and solutions related to their learning experience.

From organization, study planning, note-taking, to time management, your child can build up their academic abilities with a private tutor. Independence is built on the foundation of these skills. Plus students inherently learn about taking responsibility as they see that their efforts have positive results.
