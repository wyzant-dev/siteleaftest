### Updating the Homepage

The homepage content is configurable from the **Settings** section of the cms. In here, you can update the background image of the hero, text, and meta descriptions. Additionally, the site banner is authored here and will update every page it is present on.

### Creating Blog Posts

Blog posts are created in either the **Marketing Posts** or **Tutor Posts** section depending on which blog you are publishing to. The content is written in markdown and the article is configurable based on the meta data fields found here.

#### Available Meta Fields:

##### title:
<div class="required">REQUIRED</div>
This is the title of the blog. This title also becomes part of the url.

##### content:
<div class="required">REQUIRED</div>
Main body of the article.

##### identefier:
<div class="required">REQUIRED</div>
Do not edit this field.

##### meta-title:
<div class="optional">OPTIONAL</div>
